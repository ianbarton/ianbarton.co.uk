** A Night on Moel Siabod - April 2010.

I have always liked the idea of spending a night on the summit of Moel
Siabod. The views over Snowdonia and the other Welsh mountains to the
south are unrivalled. In the recent spell of settled fine weather I
decided it was time to actually go and do it.

I arrived in Capel Curig about 4:30pm and parked in the small car park
at Bryn Glo. I packed my sack and started walking along the A5
crossing the bridge at Pont Cyfyng. I walked up the farm track,
familiar from many past ascents of Siabod, reaching the final ladder
style at the end of the track. It was sunny and the sky was almost
clear, but there was a slight haze.

My intention was to walk up past Lyn y Foel and ascend the Ddear Ddu
Ridge to the summit. However, when I reached the lake the shore was
very wet and boggy after the snowy winter. I traversed along a good
path on the headwall above the lake, thinking that I could climb up
onto the ridge about half way up. I made my way up to the foot of the
ridge and began climbing up what looked like a good way onto the
crest. However, the final hundred feet up a steep corner filled with
grass proved harder than expected. I was carrying quite a heavy sack
and it all felt very insecure. I wimped out and climbed back down,
traversing back to the path. The path continued directly up a gully
filled with loose scree. It wasn't difficult, but it was unpleasant.

Finally I emerged on the summit ridge close to the summit trig point. I
hadn't stopped all the way up was very hot and sweaty. I sat just
below the trig point, sheltered from a cool breeze to drink a Fruit
Shoot and eat a couple of almond slices. I left the sack close to the
stone shelter, just below the trig point and reconnoitred for a good
camp site. There was a cool north easterly breeze, but the forecast
was good and no high winds were predicted.

There is a nice flat grassy area just to the north west of the summit
shelter, which is where I decided to pitch the tent. By the time I had
got the tent pitched and unpacked my gear it was getting very cold. I
boiled some water to make a hot chocolate and to rehydrate my pasta
and cheese meal. It was now cold enough that I needed to wear all my
layers, plus gloves to stop my hands freezing.

The sun was rapidly disappearing, so I wandered round taking some
photos. I also managed to get a couple of pictures of myself outside the
tent by perching the phone on a rock and using the self timer. I
retreated inside the tent and got into my sleeping bag to warm myself
up. Surprisingly, there was good T-Mobile coverage on the summit, so I
sent a couple of photos from the phone back home.

When I had warmed up I went back outside the tent. By now it was
completely dark. The sky was clear and I could see the bright lights
of what I presumed was Bangor in the distance. The clear sky and north
easterly breeze mean that it had now got very cold. My fingers were
numb within a few seconds of removing my gloves, so I scuttled back
inside the tent and got back into my sleeping bag.

This was the first outing from my Thermarest Neoair. I was surprised
at just how comfortable it was, definitely a good purchase. I drifted
in and out of sleep finally getting up about 5:30am. Sunrise was
supposedly shortly after 6:00am, but I could see a red glow on the
horizon. It had been cold outside the tent during the night. My little
keyring thermometer showed that it was around -4C and the outside of
the tent was covered in a layer of ice.

Stupidly I had left the stove outside the tent. Even though I was
using Coleman Propane/Butane mix there wasn't enough pressure to work
the stove properly. I stuck the canister in my sleeping bag for 10
mins and tried again. This time it worked fine. My Primus Spider stove
has a pre-heating coil, so once the stove was lit it was soon roaring
away. I made a cup of hot chocolate and had some more almond slices. I
wandered around taking more photos. The sky was completely clear and
yesterdays evening haze had completely dispersed. The valleys to the
south of Siabod were filled with mist, but those to the north were
clear.

I hung around for about an hour waiting for it to get a bit warmer
before packing up and descending the north east ridge to the farm
track. I got back to the car about 8:45am and drove round to Llanberis
for a well deserved breakfast in Pete's Eats.
