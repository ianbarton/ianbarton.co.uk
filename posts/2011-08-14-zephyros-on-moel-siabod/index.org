I had wanted to try my Zephyros for some time, but hadn't had an
opportunity to take it into the mountains. The weather had settled
into the pattern of recent years, with a dry Spring, but wet and
unsettled weather throughout the Summer. However, a brief window of
opportunity was forecast mid-week with bad weather clearing in the
afternoon, followed by a brighter day.

I had hoped to use one of the routes over the Arans from [[http://v-g.me.uk][v-g's]]
site. However, it didn't look as though the good weather would last
long enough. So, I decided on a late afternoon ascent of Moel Siabod
from Capel Curig, camping near to the summit and returning to Capel
early the next morning. It was school holidays (which probably
explains the bad weather), so I persuaded one of my daughters (Ella)
that camping on top of a mountain in dodgy weather was a good idea.

Driving over the Llandegla Moors, rain began to pour down from the
grey skies, so much for the promised clear weather in the
afternoon. When we reached the A5, it had stopped raining, but the sky
was entirely covered in low grey clouds. Driving up from Betwys y Coed
I caught occasional glimpses of the summit of Siabod trough the
cloud. It wasn't raining continuously, but there were frequent heavy
showers. We had tea in the Pinnacle cafe in Capel Curig before driving
back to the car park near to the Bryn y Glo cafe.

Ella sat in the car while I packed the rucksack in the rain. When we
set off the sky was covered in low grey cloud and it was raining
intermittently. I glanced over the bridge at Pont y ??? and noticed
that the level of water in the river was well up for the time of
year. After a short distance we turned right and started up the steep
farm track, following the diversion that takes the path away from the
farm buildings. As we made our way along the track over the moors, I
could see that the summit of Siabod was covered in cloud. Rather than
try and camp on the summit, I decided that we would be better off
camping next to Llyn y Foel and hope that the weather was better in
the morning..

This was Ella's first trip up Siabod and I was regretting not waiting
for better conditions. Also, her boots were leaking badly and since
the path was running with water, her feet were soon soaked. We made
our way up through the old quarry workings and stopped to stare into a
couple of the flooded workings. On a sunny day the water appears in
vivid colours, caused by the different dissolved minerals. However,
today it just looked grey, like the sky above.

As we approached Llyn y Foel a few breaks appeared in the clouds and
the summit cleared. After a bit of deliberation we decided to continue
over the Ddear Ddu ridge to the summit. Unfortunately, the path past Llyn
y Foel was very boggy and Ella's feet got even wetter. The Ddear Ddu ridge was
a pleasant scramble, but needed care as the rock was quite
greasy. Also I was hampered by carrying a heavy pack. I made my way
slowly up the ridge, with Ella skipping along behind like a faun.

I could see the clouds racing over the summit and wondered how windy
it was going to be on top. The forecast was for winds gusting up to
45mph, but falling back to 25mph later in the day. By the time we had
reached the final rocks below the summit, the cloud had risen some way
above the summit and there were some large patches of blue sky
appearing. Once we got onto the summit ridge it was very windy and
Ella sat in the summit shelter, covered by my bothy bag, while I went
in search of a suitable spot to pitch the tent.

There is a nice flat area to the North of the summit, which has great
views over Snowdon and the Glyders, where I pitched the tent on my
 last trip. However, it was exposed to the full force of the westerly
wind, which was blowing me about and was definitely not the place to
pitch the tent. I back tracked to the area on the southern slope, just below
the summit ridge, where I found a nice flat area close to the summit
cairn.

I unpacked the Zephyros and had it pitched in less than 10 minutes. I
climbed back up to the summit shelter and fetched Ella and we put all
our gear into the tent. The Zephyros 2 is very cosy for two and you
can only just fit two sleeping mats side by side. It was now about
8:30pm and the light was fading. I found it was possible to cook in
the porch, but you really need to have the flysheet open to avoid
setting light to the tent! After a cup of hot chocolate and some
porridge and sultanas, we settled down for the night. Contrary to the
forecast the wind didn't drop at all during the night. We could hear
the roar of the gale on the other side of the summit ridge and blasts
of wind that made it over the ridge rattled the Zephyros. However, the
tent stood up to the wind and sharp showers during the night without
any problems.

The wind kept us awake most of the night and we dropped off to sleep
about 4:00pm, waking again about 6:30am. Wisps of cloud were blowing
over the summit and the wind hadn't dropped at all during the
night. After a cup of hot chocolate we decide to pack up and go down
to the valley for breakfast. We crossed over to the northern side of
the summit ridge and dropped down below the crest, to avoid scrambling
over the rocks. We were now exposed to the full force of the wind. I
was being buffeted and Ella was struggling to stay on her feet. I
could see sheets of rain blowing along the Ogwen Valley over Capel
Curig. Luckily, although we were exposed to the gale, the rain showers
passed us by. It felt much more like Autumn than early August.

Once we started dropping down the southern slopes we were sheltered
from the wind and made quick progress down the eroded path back to
the end of the track. We got back to the car about 9:00am and went
straight round to Pete's Eats for breakfast!
