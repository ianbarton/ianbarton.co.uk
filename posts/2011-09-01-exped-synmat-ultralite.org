Summary: "Comparison of the Exped Synmat Ultralite and the Thermarest Neoair"

I am a big fan of my Thermarest Neoair, which is very comfortable,
light and packs down small. However, I find that I tend to roll off it
when I am asleep. Recently I needed to buy another light weight mat
for one of the family. Rather than just buy another Neoair, I did some
research and discovered the [[http://www.facewest.co.uk/Exped-SynMat-Ultralite.html][Exped Synmat Ultralite]] .

Like the Neoair the Synmat is an inflatable, but there are significant
differences. The Neoair relies on internal baffles, which prevent
convection, to achieve its insulation. The Synmat is filled with
Primaloft, which is laminated to the walls. This prevents the filling
from migrating and allows for greater loft.

The Neoair uses a single valve for both inflation and deflation, but
the Synmat has two separate one way valves. Most people inflate the
Neoair by mouth. You can inflate the Synmat the same way, but moisture
from your breath will eventually compromise the effectiveness of the
Primaloft. Exped sell a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGGIi7Of2ZFU][pillow pump]] , which functions both as a pillow
filled with expanding foam and an air pump. I decided to buy a pillow
pump, which works well both as a pump and a very comfortable pillow.

There is one other important difference in construction between the
Synmat and the Neoair. The inflatable tubes in the Neoair run
horizontally, whilst those in the Synmat run vertically along the
length of the mat. The outer tubes of the Synmat are slightly larger
than the inner tubes, which makes it harder to roll off the mat.

So how do the two mats compare for sleeping on? I haven't tested
either mat in really cold conditions, but both kept me warm. Note the
Synmat has a slightly higher R value, so in theory should provide
better insulation. Both mats require about the same effort to inflate
and pack down to a very similar size. However, I did find the Synmat
slightly more comfortable than the Neoair and more importantly I
didn't roll off the Synmat during the night.

The Neoair feels quite flimsy compared to the Synmat, but I haven't
had a problem with punctures. A nice detail is that the Synmat comes
with a repair kit, whereas you have to buy one for the Neoair.

So which do I prefer? It's a very close call, I like both mats and
compared to other types of sleeping mat like my old Karrimat, or self
inflating mats, they are streets ahead in terms of comfort, lightness
and pack size. I marginally prefer the Synmat as I find it slightly
more comfortable and so far I haven't rolled off it.

** Comparison of Weights, Size and Insulation.

|------------------+----------------+--------+---------|
| Mat              | Size           | Weight | R Value |
|------------------+----------------+--------+---------|
| Synmat (medium)  | 183 x 52 x 7   | 474g   |     3.5 |
| Neoair (regular) | 183 x 51 x 6.3 | 396g   |     2.5 |

Dimensions are the manufacturer's stated ones. Weights were measured
on my scales and include the stuff sack.
