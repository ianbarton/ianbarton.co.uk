In the last couple of months I have been buying some new
walking/climbing gear. Quite a bit of my outdoor clothing is getting
rather battered and worn out (a bit like me). In the past I have used
a tee shirt/fleece/Goretex jacket layering system.

For cold weather I have a complete Buffalo system, which was very
kindly given to me by Hamish Hamilton about 20 years ago. For cold
snowy conditions e.g. Scotland/Alps this is excellent and I am sure
that it will last a few more years yet. However, once the temperature
gets above freezing it's far too hot, even with maximum venting.

In the last couple of months I have bought a couple of Paramo tops,
which keep my nice and warm when I am walking or cycling. However, if
it's very windy, or when I stop for a while I need something to put
over the top. I do have a Buffalo belay jacket, but that's far too
warm and bulky. In the past I have packed a fleece jacket in my sack,
but even that was relatively heavy and bulky.

A couple of weeks ago I noticed a [[http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/primaloft/generator_smock---85/][Rab Generator Smock]] in the sale at
[[http://www.joe-brown.com/][Joe Brown's]]  in Llanberis. This has a Pertex Quantum inner and outer
with Primaloft 1 fill. Primaloft is a man made fibre, similar to
down. However, unlike down it doesn't transform itself into a soggy
lump when it gets damp. The smock weighs around 330 grammes and packs
up into its own chest pocket, so I am happy to carry it with me all
the time.

I gave in to temptation and bought one. I am very glad that I did.
