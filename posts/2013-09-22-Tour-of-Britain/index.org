As a keen cyclist I was pleased to hear that stage four of the [[http://tourofbritian.co.uk][Tour of
Britain]] was passing within a couple of miles of where I lived. I
decided that the best place to get a good view was outside the local
pub, where the race had to negotiate a "T" junction. The race was due
to pass the pub about 12:00pm, so I left home shortly after eleven on
the 20 minute ride, to give my self plenty of time to find a good
spot.



Even though we were in the depths of the Shropshire countryside there
was a good turn out of spectators, many of whom arrived by cycle. I
hadn't realized how much organization was involved in getting the
Peleton safely along the route. Police motorycle outriders started
arriving about 20 mins. before the riders. In all there must have been
around 20 motorbikes ahead of the peleton.

Finally the lead breakaway group, which was about two and a half
minutes ahead of the peleton arrived. I hadn't appreciated how fast
the riders would be cycling. Even going round the T junction they were
going so quickly that most of my photos were blurred. After the
peleton zoomed past, I resumed my ride, getting in a very modest 20
mile round trip back home.
