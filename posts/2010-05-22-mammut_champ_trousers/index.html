For a few years I have worn Craghopper Kiwi trousers almost all the
time. I am in the lucky position of being able to wear whatever I want
most of the time, so I tend to choose clothes that are both practical
and I feel comfortable in.
</p>

<p>
The Kiwi's are great and if you shop around you can pick them up for
around £25, rather than the rrp. of £40. They are reasonably wind
proof and dry very quickly when wet. However, one problem is that they
also get wet very quickly in a shower, or if you brush against
something like wet bracken.
</p>

<p>
If it's really cold I have my Buffalo salopettes, but at anything
above freezing they are far too warm. I wanted something that was more
water resistant than the Kiwis, but not too warm to wear in Spring and
Autumn. Initially I considered the Paramo Cascadas, but decided that
these were probably too bulky and heavy for me.
</p>

<p>
There are a bewildering number of "Mountain Trousers" available at
various price points. I made a short list of desirable properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reasonably windproof and light.</li>

<li>Water resistant.</li>

<li>Articulated knees so I could use them for scrambling and climbing.</li>

<li>Hard wearing - I tend to use my gear a lot and want it to last.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I read numerous reviews and trawled various forums looking for
advice. Eventually, I settled on Mammut Base Jumps. They had many
positive reviews and are available in a wide range of sizes - I have
long legs, so wanted to make sure I didn't end up with something that
was too short. However, just when I decided what I wanted, Mammut
decided to discontinue the original Base Jump and bring out a new
model. No on in the UK had a pair available in my size.
</p>

<p>
When the new design became available, it was even more expensive than
the already expensive old Base Jumps. Luckily, I found out that I
could buy Mammut Champs, which are basically  the same as the Base
Jumps, but more expensive. They were now cheaper than the new range of
Base Jumps. I took a deep breath and bought a pair of Champs from V12,
who are the main distributor in the UK. The price of £116 was more
than I have ever paid for a pair of trousers before.
</p>

<p>
I was initially very uncertain about paying so much for a pair of
trousers. However, having worn them a number of times I am very hapy
with them. They are very comfortable and whilst not completely wind
proof, the fabric is very breathable so I don't sweat. This makes them
great for both walking and cycling. I hate waterproof over trousers
and though I have a pair I almost never wear them. The Champs are
water resistant to the extent that I don't bother carrying my
waterproof over trousers, thus saving some weight. I think that rain
heavy enough to soak the Champs would get through over trousers too.
</p>

<p>
The bottoms are expandable, so the trousers will fit if you are
wearing big boots in winter. There are two zip pockets and a single
large thigh pocket. The material seems to be durable, time will tell
how long it lasts.
