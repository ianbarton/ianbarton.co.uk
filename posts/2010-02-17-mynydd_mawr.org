Mynydd Mawr is an outlier of the Moel Hebog group and is situated
between Snowdon and the Nantlle Ridge. It's not very high - 698m or
2269ft, but because of it's position the views from the top are
spectacular.

Most people start from Rhyd Ddu, the route going past the Craig y
Bera, which has the excellent climb Angel Pavement. However, we were
staying in the adjacent valley at [[http://www.tycochsnowdonia.co.uk/][Hen Ysgubor]], which is at the foot of
the mountain, so that's where I started my climb.

Please note that you can't follow the exact route I describe unless
you are staying in the house, as it crosses farmland belonging to the
house. However, it's possible to start on the road between Waunfawr
and Rhosgadfan (SH  514583).

From Hen Ysgubor I walked up the fields behind the house to reach the
edge of the trees at approximately 532566.

From the top of the first steep rise trending generally left brings
you out to a stone wall at !!!!! It's possible to cross the wall in
the corner of the field via the stone sheepfold (528559) by going
through the holes under the wall. There are also several big flat
stones on top of the wall at various points. If you are very careful
not to damage the wall, you can climb over the wall.

The track up the Eastern slope (not marked on the map) of the mountain
is obvious from here. There is a steep pull up to some old mine
workings, surrounded by a fence (be careful not to fall in). The path
continues steeply upwards and contours along the edge of Craig Cwm
Du. These vegetated cliffs provide some good Winter climbs in
suitable, but rare, conditions.

As you reach the top the path becomes fainter and you need to bear
right. In poor visibility you will probably need to use your
compass. It seems a long pull up to the summit, which isn't visible
until your are about a hundred yards away. However, once you get there
the views are stunning. Like Moel Siabod, Mynydd Mawr is an isolated
summit and so provides extensive views of the other peaks. On one side
you have the Nantlle Ridge and on the other Snowdon and the
Glyders. There are also good views over Caernarfon and Anglesey.

From the summit you can descend to Rhydd Ddu, or simply retrace your steps.
