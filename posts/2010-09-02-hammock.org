The girls have been pestering me for months to buy a hammock. By
accident I noticed that the [[http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk][backpackinglight]] web site had a
special promotion on lightweight [[http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/product29.asp?PageID%3D41][silk]] hammocks. I ordered one and with
the usual efficient service it arrived next day.

Originally I was going to hang it using the frame from the swings, but
this turned out to be not quite long enough. Luckily the gate near the
back door has trees either side and the gap was just right for hanging
the hammock. For anyone else who wants to try this, the posts that you
hang the hammock from need to be about 12 feet apart.

It has been a great success, I have hardly been able to get the
children out of it since I put it up!
