** Day One - Tanygrisiau to Moelwyn Mawr.
This was another trip shamelessly nicked from [[http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/T0863/T0863.htm][v-g's]] web site. I was
hoping to do it with the children, but the weather forecast looked too
dodgy to take them. The initial plan was either to do this trip, or
another one over the Arans. Read on to see why I didn't do the Arans
trip.

MWIS forecast good chance of clear summits, but with heavy hail
showers blowing in. I was hoping to complete my aborted trip over Aran
Benllyn, camping at Creiglyn Dyfi and walking out the next day. As I
drove through Whitchurch the heavens opened, but once I arrived at
Wrexham the roads were dry and the sun was out. However, as I
approached the A5 outside Corwen, I could see thick cloud in front. As
I arrived at the traffic lights at the end of the A5104, it began
pouring with rain. Hoping it might just be a heavy shower I turned off
the A5 towards Bala. After three or four miles I could see that there
were no breaks in the cloud and it was absolutely pouring down. There
didn't seem to be any point in continuing, so I turned the car round
at set off back along the A5 towards Capel Curig.

After only a few miles along the A5 it had stopped raining. As I
approached Pentrefoelas I could see that the most of the main summits
were either cloud free, or only lightly covered. However, I didn't
think that the weather would be suitable for camping on one of the
higher summits around Capel Curig, so I turned off along the B4407
towards Blaenau Ffestiniog . I parked at the small car park at the end
of the access road to Llyn Stwlan. The skies were very grey, but the
summits of the Moelwyns were clear of cloud.

I packed my sack and glanced at my watch. It was now 4:00pm, but I
reckoned that I would have more than enough time to get to the summit
of Moelwyn Bach. I followed a man walking his dog up the road towards
the resevoir, where I filled my water bottles. It's not possible to
walk along the top of the wall to get to the far side, so I had to
descend a short distance to get back to the start of the path. I
didn't particularly want to go up to the col at Bwlch Stwlan between
the two peaks, as I would have to descend from Moelwyn Bach over the
same ground. So thought I would climb up the end of the South Ridge
and traverse it to the summit of Molewyn Bach before descending to
Bwlch Stwlan. I worked over to the left towards the base of the ridge,
following a line of small concrete marker posts. As I gained height, I
could see a huge hole in the hill, presumably some old quarry
workings. Looking up at the ridge I could see that I would have to
climb over a rocky section to gain the crest. From below this didn't
look too hard, but I was conscious that I was pressed for time and I
didn't want to waste time if I picked the wrong line up the
hill. Luckily, there appeared to be a terrace that ran across the face
of the hill, leading to the col. There was a distinct path along most
of the terrace, with a couple of interesting sections where parts
of the path had collapsed.

At Bwlch Stwlan I was exposed to the wind blowing in from the West. I
thought of dumping my pack at the Bwlch while I climbed up to the
summit of Moelwyn Bach. For some stupid reason I was worried that
someone might take it, even though it was late in the day and there
was nobody else about. Thus, I ended up carying it all the way to the
top and back again. Most of the path up towards the summit is on the
East face, which was sheltered from the wind. However, once I gained
the summit ridge I was exposed to its full force. The clouds had been
coming and going around the summit while I was climbing up, but when I
reached the summit cairn there were good views in all directions. I
tried to brace myself against the cairn to take some photos, but it
was almost impossible in the buffeting wind.

After a couple of minutes on top, I retraced my steps to the col and
began the ascent of Moelwyn Mawr via Craigysgafn. I could see sheets
of "stuff" blowing in from the west. Within a few seconds I was being
shot blasted by small hail stones. I was exposed to the full force of
the wind for most of the climb and the layer of hail on the rock made
the scrambling sections interesting. I was very relieved when the hail
ceased just before I got to the summit cairn.

There is a small grassy platform just below the summit cairn, which
seemed quite sheltered. However, I was worried that the wind might
shift round during the night and in any case the summit was completely
misted out. I knew that somewhere there was an easy descent back
towards Llyn Croesor, but in the clag I couldn't see an easy way down
the steep ground. I pulled out the map and decided to descend the
North West ridge and then traverse over towards Llyn Croesor. It was
now well after 6:00pm and I wanted to find a good sport before it went
dark.

I hurried down the North West ridge hoping to drop out of the clag. I
wasn't entirely sure exactly where I was and in the words of the great
HW Tilman "No one goes so far, or so fast, as the man who does not
know where he is going". Eventually I dropped below the clag to fine
views of Cwm Croesor. It didn't look as though I could traverse easily
and the alternative was a long descent, followed by an equally long
climb back up.

I made the decision to do what I should have done in the first place -
camp on the summit. I had lost just over a hundred metres, so it was a
bit of a slog back up. When I finally got back there, the wind seemed
to have dropped considerably, but it was still misted out. I was wet
through and my fingers were freezing as I struggled to get the tent
up. I had just finished putting it up when suddenly the clag cleared
and I could see from horizon to horizon. The sun was setting and it
would be dark soon. Once I had thrown everything into the tent, I went
for a short walk around the summit area. In the perfect visibility I
now easily found the start of the descent path. I set a waypoint on my
GPS, so I could find it again in the morning.

I made my way back to the tent to get into some dry gear and cook
tea. The spot I had chosen turned out to be very sheltered and I had a
quiet night.

** Day Two Moel-yr-hydd and Cwm Orthin.
I was up around 6:30am. Looking out of the tent the
summit was still shrouded in mist, but the wind had dropped and it
wasn't hailing or raining. As I was packing away the tent,
there were several spells of just a few seconds when the cloud would
clear and I could see the views. I waited for a while, but it didn't
seem as though the cloud would disperse for more than a few seconds at
a time, so I set off. I found the start of the descent easily now I
knew where it was and had soon dropped out of the clag.

I made my way over towards Moel yr Hydd and was treated to some mini
cloud inversions in the valley over Blaneau. The summit of Moel yr
Hydd was clear and I paused to take some photos before descending
towards the old quarry workings. I made my way down through the levels
towards Llyn Cwm Orthin. The weather was gradually getting worse as I
descended. The clouds were dropping and the drizzle was turning into
persistent rain. However, I managed to get back to the car before it
got too bad.

Overall a very satisfying trip. I was lucky that the gaps in the bad
weather came at just the right moments and on the second day I got
back to the car just before it got really bad!

Some notes about gear:

Once again my Rab Vapour Rise trousers and jacket worked
superbly. Although they absorbed water my skin was dry. In the morning
the trousers were heavy with the water they had absorbed. As it wasn't
far above freezing, I wasn't looking forward to putting them
on. However, the inner fleece lining felt dry and far from having cold
legs, I immediately felt warm.
