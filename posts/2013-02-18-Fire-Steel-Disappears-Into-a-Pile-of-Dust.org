Title: My Fire Steel Crumbles to Dust.

After my walk over Moel Famau and Moel Arthur I was looking forward
to making a hot drink. My brew kit lives permanently in the boot of
the truck, so I don't forget to take it with me! I unpacked my Primus
Gravity stove from its pouch and connected up a gas cylinder.

I use a
Light My Fire [[http://www.lightmyfire.com/products/sparking-fire-collection/swedish-firesteel-20.aspx][Swedish Fire Steel]] rather than matches or a
lighter. This will generate a spark under almost any conditions and
doesn't run out of gas, or refuse to light when soggy, like lighters
and, matches. I keep it in a small zipped section of the pouch that
the stove lives in. I pulled it out, so I coud light the stove and
noticed that the steel was now only about half an inch long! I
thought that it must have somehow got broken, but looking inside the
pouch there was nothing but a pile of grey dust. Luckily there was
just enough left to generate a spark and light my stove.

When I got home I spent some time Googling and found that other
people had had similar problems: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DR4pfZAcPq3o][here]] and there was a possible
[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXhPyig4ra40][explanation]] . It would appear that contact with inorganic salts and
water can make the fire steel, which is made from an alloy called
Ferrocerium, can act as a battery. This results in the fire steel
corroding away. The bag containing my steel may well have been
slightly damp, but as far as I know it hadn't come into contact with
any salt solutions unless something spilt on the bag had soaked through.

Anyway, lesson learned. Always check your fire steel before setting
out. Even something you think couldn't possibly fail can do so in an
unexpected way.
