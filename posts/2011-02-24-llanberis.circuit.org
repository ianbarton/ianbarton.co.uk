I found this ride in "BikeFax - The best mountain bike trails in
Snowdonia". It's probably the easiest ride in the book, but well worth
doing. It's all on tracks or minor roads and is suitable for all but
very young children. You don't need a "Mountain Bike" for this route,
a road bike will be fine.

 - Time around 1.5 hours.
 - Distance 10.5km.
 - Ascent 225m.

You could start the ride in several places. We have started from the
Caban at Brynrefail and from the lake at Llanberis. However,
the parking at Llanberis is Pay and Display, whereas the parking near
to the Caban is free.


From the Caban cycle over the bridge and turn left following the Lon
Las Peris route. You will have to lift your bikes over the first gate
on the old road. When the track meets the main road, pay close
attention to the signs. You need to go along the footpath a hundred
yards or so in the direction of Caernarfon and then cross the road,
where the track continues back in the direction of Llanberis. Soon
after crossing the road you pass through a short tunnel. You don't
need lights, but it can be quite dark so take care when cycling.

The path follows the shore of Llyn Padarn to emerge at the large car
park by the main road. Cross the road at the far end of the car park
and go past (or into) Pete's Eats. The route continues up Goodman
Street opposite to Pete's Eats. The steepest section of the ride is
just in front, but it's short lived. There is quite a lot more uphill,
but nothing really steep.

Make sure that you stop by the quarries and look through the fence
into their depths. As you continue to climb the views open
out. Snowdon and the Glyders behind and the coast and Anglesey in
front. The high point is Pen Y Bwlch and you now begine the steep
descent towards Bryn Bas Castle. Care is needed here because you may
meet cars coming uphill around the blind bends.

When you reach the castle you pass under an arch formed by the castle
walls and shortly after turn right. There is a short uphill section
before the final steep descent, via a couple of hairpins, into Cwm y
Glo. At the junction turn right and continue until you reach the
junction with the main road.

Cross the road, turning right towards Llanberis. After a short
distance take the first turn left. This looks like the entrance to an
industrial estate at first glance. Tun right and follow a track which
emerges on the main road opposite to the bridge to Brynrefail. Cross
the main road and continue back to the Caban for well earned
refreshments.
