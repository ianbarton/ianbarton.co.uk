The West coast of Ireland is great for cycling. The coastal scenery
is spectacular and the roads are quiet. This circular route takes the
??? peninsula just south of Clifden. It's worth noting the wind
direction before starting out, as it can often be quite breezy and a
bit of advance planning will minimize the distance you are peddling
into the wind. This was to be a family ride.
</p>

<p>
We parked in a layby just outside Ballyconneely, but there are
numerous parking places all around the route. In fact you could
easily start from Clifden. We decided to cycle anti-clockwise, which
meant that on the day the first part of the ride was into the
wind. As is often the case in Ireland, the weather was fickle and
there were frequent sharp showers. We had planned to stop at one of
the beaches before we reached Roundstone, but decided to press
on. Shortly before Roundstone there is a bit of an ascent, followed
by a nice long descent to the beach at Gurteen Bay.
</p>

<p>
The girls were getting fed up of peddling into the wind and getting
soaked on a regular basis. We agreed that they would stop in
Roundstone and I would continue around the rest of the loop and fetch
the car. I set off only pausing in Roundstone to buy some
chocolate. The town is in idyllic spot next to the sea.
</p>

<p>
I thought that the section of the ride from Roundstone was the
highlight. After following the road along the coast you take a left
turn and climb up over the moors of Roundstone Bog. There are great
views of the Twelve Bens to the North. The ground either side of the
road is very boggy and there are hundreds of small pools. This section
of the ride is very exposed and wouldn't be a good place to be in
really bad weather. The wind was now behind me, which only increased
my enjoyment of this section of the ride.
</p>

<p>
Soon I reached the junction with the main road from Clifden. Shortly
after you rejoin the road, you can follow a track up to the left,
which takes you to the Alcock and Brown landing site. THey were the
first people to fly over the Atlantic and given the nature of the
terrain it's amazing that they weren't killed on landing. The track
takes you up to the site of the old Marconi radio station and a large
concrete obelisk commemorating the flight. The actual landing site is
about 500m from the obelisk. If you want to visit it, be prepared for
some bog trotting and wet feet.
</p>

<p>
I cycled back along the track to rejoin the main road and was soon
back at Ballyconneely. By the time I had driven over to Roundstone
the girls had set off and I caught up with them just as they turned
off to Roundstone Bog.
