Llyn Brenig is a man made reservoir situated in a large area of
moorland between Denbigh and the A5. There a many possible rides in
this area. The one described is a circuit of the lake and is
approximately 10 miles long. There is a short section along a B road,
but this isn't normally busy. The ride is described going round the
lake in an anticlockwise direction, as route finding is easier this
way.

From the Visitor Centre find the track that runs in a southerly
direction along the side the reservoir. It starts opposite the cycle
hire place. Cycle over the dam and follow the stone track along the
reservoir. This leads through a short section of forest and finally
onto a small lane. Follow the lane to the junction with the B4510 ad
turn left onto the road.

This is where the uphill section starts! It isn't too steep but is
fairly continuous. Eventually you reach the summit, where the map
shows a parking place with picnic table. In April 2010 the table
wasn't there, but the parking place is a good place to admire the view
and recover from the climb.

There is now a nice downhill section, which leads to a T
junction. Turn left and take the second forestry track on the left
(the first one leads to a dead end). This descends down to the
reservoir, where you can follow the shore back to the Visitor
Centre. Be careful not to take any turns leading off to the right as
these will lead you back to the B4501.
