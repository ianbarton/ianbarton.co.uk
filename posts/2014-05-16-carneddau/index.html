&lt;/div&gt;

<p>
I had wanted to get out backpacking all year, but my free time had
always coincided with periods of poor weather. Finally I could get out
for a couple of days and the forecast was good. The plan was to drive
into Cwm Eigiau and do a two day traverse. I had done a similar route
a couple of years ago, but wanted to do a similar route in reverse
starting at Pen Llithrig y Wrach and going clockwise around the ridge.
</p>

<div class="HTML">
<p>
&lt;!– PELICAN<sub>END</sub><sub>SUMMARY</sub> –&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Last year various bits of the road into Cwm Egiau were widened and new
passing places installed and the road was closed for several
months. Before these improvements there were only a very limited
number of places where passing was possible, so meeting a mini bus
coming in the opposite direction usually involved a fair bit of
reversing. This wasn't much fun as there are several hair pin bends
and some 20% gradients. As luck would have it, I met a large mini bus coming
down just next to the first gate. I had to bump up onto the grass pull
in next to the gate to let it past. At the second gate I passed
someone walking up the road and he kindly to closed the gate for me.
</p>

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
The weather forecast was for early morning mist over the summits to
clear by midday. However, at 10:30am the summits were all misted out
and I wondered if I had made the right choice in coming up into Cwm
Eigiau.
</p>

<p>
There were only a couple of cars parked in the car park. While I was
getting ready the man who had opened the gate stopped to chat with
me. He was originally from Dolgarrog, but was now living in
Manchester. He had camped further down the road and was going to walk
over to Llyn Colwyd before going back to Dolgarrog.

</p>

<p>
I bumped into him again when I went up to the reservoir to fill my
water bottles. He asked if he could walk with me up towards Pen
Llithrig yr Wrach. We set off along a track that leads up to an old
quarry on the slopes of Pen Llithrig yr Wrach. I hadn't been this way
before and there are some impressive holes in the ground, which I
presume are old mine entrances. Part of the way along the track I
realised that I had left my stove in the car. My walking companion
very kindly offered to let me borrow his, but I said that I would
manage OK. When we got to the ridge he turned off to descend towards
Llyn Colwyd. I plodded on up the summit of Pen y Llithrig y Wrach,
which was still covered in mist. Luckily the mist cleared just as I
reached the summit and I was able to enjoy good views while I sat and
ate my sandwich and chocolate brownie.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
I still hadn't decided what to do about the missing stove. All my
camping food was dehydrated, so without hot water I wasn't going to be
able to eat until I got back to the car. I had my Travel Tap, so I
could top up my water supplies from the various pools of water.  At
first I thought I might be able to gather enough old heather roots to
make a fire. However, there was very little old heather about and most
of it was damp.  Eventually, I decided to press on and see how I felt
later in the day. The slope up to Pen yr Helgi Du seemed harder than
the last time I did it. I stopped a couple of times on the way to the
summit.   As I descended to Bwlch Eryl
Farchog I got cramp in my legs, probably because I wasn't drinking enough water.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the brief scramble up to the summit of Craig yr
Ysfa. However, the long ridge leading up to Carnedd Llelwlyn was very slow
going . If I had got the stove with me, I would probably camped at
the spot Ella and I used in ??? at the foot of the final ridge, even thought it was still early
afternoon. In retrospect I should have brought more water and some
carbohydrate snacks with me. Eventually I arrived at the summit, which was covered in mist
despite being clear a few minutes earlier. Luckily, the mist cleared just long
enough for me to take a photo of Moel Siabod.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

<p>
 I thought I might camp next to the small pools of water on
Gledrffordd. At least I would have water and wouldn't be too far from
the car the next morning. I glimpsed the pools through brief clearings
in the mist. However, I wasn't at all certain how to get down to them
and the detail of that area on my Harveys BMC map didn't really give
me any clues. I was pretty certain it was a straightforward slope, but
didn't really know where I needed to turn off the main ridge and it
there would be any crags that weren't marked on my map. I set off in
the direction of Foel Goch, finding the bouldery initial section hard
going. I checked the GPS a couple of times to fix my position on the
map. It was still very misty and I couldn't see the descent to
Gledrffordd. As I lost a bit of height the mist cleared and I could
see the path clearly in front of me. I descended from the crest of the
ridge towards the path and in the distance I could see the pools of
water on Gledrffordd. I didn't feel too bad going downhill, but still
got a few attacks of cramp. I didn't have a lot of water left and
wanted to conserve it in case I couldn't find a stream.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
As I made may way towards Gledrffordd, I began to think it might be
more sensible to descend all the way back to the car, as I was feeling
very hungry. The prospect of lying awake all night thinking I could
eat if I continued the relatively short distance back to the car
wasn't appealing. It seemed a long way to over the grassy plateau to
the pools on Gledrffordd, but eventually I reached the rocky crest at
the end. The path disappeared into the rocks and thinking that I was
at the end of the ridge , I clambered over the rocky crest and began
to descend. I should have checked the map first!

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

<p>
The valley below was obscured by mist, but this cleared after I had
descended a couple of hundred feet. I could see that I was on the
crags (Craig Eigiau) about half way along Llyn Eigiau. Trying to
descend these was not a good idea, as the ground was steep and rocky!
Painfully I regained the crest of the ridge and began traversing along
the slope below and parallel to it. Finally, the path
descended towards a Landrover track. I was very tired and hobbled
along the track eventually, rejoining the road next to the car
park. All the way down I had passed no streams and only a few muddy
pools on Gledrffordd. I would have expected more water after the recent rains.

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

<p>
Luckily there was a bottle of water inside the truck, which I drank
before retrieving the stove and staggering off towards the
reservoir. I did think of camping at Maeneira, which from other
people's reports looked an ideal spot.  However, it wasn't marked on
my Harvey map and I wasn't sure exactly where it was. I went through
the smaller of the two gaps in the dam and splashed though a boggy
area before finding somewhere drier on slightly raised ground. I
chucked down my rucksack and went over to the reservoir to fill my
water bottles. There were several Cuckoos calling as I put the tent
up.  It was well after 10:00pm before I had the tent up and my gear
stowed inside. I made a mug of hot chocolate and had a hot cereal
start to eat. Finally, before getting into my sleeping bag I drank
another cup of hot chocolate.
</p>

<p>
A short while later it got very light. Looking outside I could see
there was a full moon. The mist over the summits from earlier had
disappeared and there was a clear starry sky.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
I woke up about 5:30am, with the sun already rising. I crawled out of
the tent and put on some water to boil for a cup of hot chocolate and
to make some porridge. I was expecting to get cramp in my legs, but apart from
feeling very sore they were OK. After eating breakfast I got out the
Tyvek sheet from my rucksack and piled all the stuff from the tent on
top of it to stop it getting wet. I took my time packing away and
enjoyed looking at the scenery.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
In order to avoid the boggy section, I walked up to the big break in
the dam wall before rejoining the Landrover track. It seemed a long
way back to the truck and the sun was already getting hot. I was
wearing my new Montane insulated trousers which I had brought along
for camp use, as my Mammut Base Jumps were wet from yesterday. Once
back at the truck I changed into my lightweight Rab Treklites and felt
much better.

<p>
I drove into Caernarfon and joined the A55 driving towards Bangor. I
stopped at Y Caban in Deniolen. It was only 8:50am and they didn't
open until 9:00am, so I sat on the seats outside, enjoying the
sunshine. They were having a veggie week, so my sausage sandwich was
vegetarian. I am not a vegetarian, but do enjoy veggie food. However,
I was wondering what the sausage would taste like.  I needn't have
worried as it tasted as good as the meat version. Y Caban is very
friendly and serves excellent food, highly recommended. I had a couple
of cups of coffee before setting off for Capel Curig.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
Just outside Joe Browns in Capel Curig I bumped into some old friends
from Sheffield and we had a chat.  They had been up Cnicht the day
before and were thinking of a Carneddau trip today.
</p>

<p>
Even though I hadn't managed to camp on a summit, it had been a
worthwhile trip and I enjoyed camping next to the reservoir. The cloud
had persisted longer than forecast, but had cleared often enough to
give me good views. Next time I'll double check to make sure I haven't
left my stove in the truck!
