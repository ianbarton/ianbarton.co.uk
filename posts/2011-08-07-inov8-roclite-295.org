I spend most of my time wearing trainers. Over the last couple of
years I have bought various Karrimor trainers/trail shoes from
Sportsdirect. These have been OK for just knocking about in, but not
particularly good for mountain walking. The main problem was the soles
of my feet got sore and I could feel almost every sharp stone digging
into my feet. So for mountain walking, I bought some moderately priced
Hi-Tec walking boots, which were very comfortable, but the soles
weren't great on wet rock, or for scrambling.

Recently I noticed that the soles of my feet were hurting almost all
of the time in my Karrimors. A quick look at the soles revealed that
they were paper thin and I was almost walking barefoot. I had read
various blog posts about Inov8's range of trail/running
shoes. Unfortunately, there aren't any local stockists who keep a
decent range actually in stock. Since I didn't want to keep wandering
around in my karrimors with paper thin soles, I visited my local
GoOutdoors, who did have a small number of different Inov8's in stock.

When I got there it turned out that the only pair I had in my size
were the Roclite 295. I had no idea what their intended use was
(running, walking), but as soon as I tried them on I felt at home in
them. A brief walk around the shop confirmed that they fitted me and
were indeed very comfortable. I bought them and chucked out my old
pair of trainers immediately.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we were going on holiday to
Chamonix. Since I was taking a load of climbing gear and we were up
against our weight limit for checked baggage, I decided to leave my
Meindl boots at home and use the Roclite 295's for walking.

On the first trip up to Lac Blanc in damp weather with a thin layer
of snow, they were perfect. Although they aren't fully waterproof, the
toe section is. Despite the snow my feet didn't get wet. Even better,
although I was carrying a reasonably loaded sack with everyone's gear
in it, my feet were comfortable. I was able to clamber over wet rocks
without slipping. A couple more walks, involving some scrambling over
rough terrain only increased my appreciation of these boots. The
cushioning worked really well on rocky trails.
