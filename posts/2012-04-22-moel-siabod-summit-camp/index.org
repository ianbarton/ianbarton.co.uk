I had planned to go for a walk in North Wales, but the [[http://www.mwis.org.uk][MWIS]] forecast
wasn't too good. There was supposed to be a good chance of clear
summits, but with hail showers possibly merging into longer periods of
continuous downpours. The weather at home wasn't too bad, so i decided
to drive over without making any definite plans about my objective.

As soon as I dropped down off the A5104 towards Corwen it looked as
though the "showers merging to form longer periods of hail", was the
most likely option. I decide to drive into Capel Curig and see what
conditions looked like there. True to form its was pouring down and
all the summits were covered in dense grey cloud. Thinking that the
outlying summits might have better conditions I drove over to
Llanberis and thence towards Waun Fawr. Dropping down into the village
I could see that M. Mawr was misted out and it was still raining in
the valley. Continuing along the road to Rhydd Ddu, I pulled into the
car park to look at the Nantlle Ridge. This too was misted out, but
there appeared to be faint hope as the ridge connecting ???? to Moel
Hebog was partially clear.

I drove on towards Beddgelert thinking that I might climb Moel Hebog,
then continue along the connecting ridge towards ??? finally returning
via the forestry tracks. However, when I parked in Beddgelert it was
raining quite hard and the mist had descended even further. Clutching
at straws I decide to continue my grand tour of Snowdonia and drove
down towards Blaenau Ffestiniog, thinking that I might do another walk
in the Moelwyns. I could see that Cnicht was clear, but when I arrived
in Blaenau Ffestiniog it was raining even harder and all the
surrounding peaks were covered in the thick grey clag. It was now
after 2:00pm and I was considering doing a low level walk in the
rain. Somehow I felt that the weather would improve later in the day,
so to complete my circuit of Snowdonia I set off over the Crimea Pass
towards talkytoaster. As I approached the summit of the pass, I could
see that the cloud over Moel Siabod was starting to lift above the
summit and the rain was slowly dying out. By the time I reached the
car park outside Bryn y Glo in Capel Curig, the rain had stopped and
the sky was brightening.

It was now 3:00pm and I decided on an overnighter on the summit of
Siabod. This is one of my favourite mountains. It's isolated position
gives it grand views over most of Snowdonia. This would be my third
summit camp on Siabod. The first in [[http://www.ian-barton.com/mountaineering/night-on-moel-siabod.html][May]] time was in perfect
weather. The [[http://ian-barton.com/blog/mountaineering/2011/08/14/zephyros-on-moel-siabod.html][second]] with one of my daughters, was in very uncertain
weather, with high winds on the summit. However, we were luck and
despite the very high wind we had good views, but a very noisy night
as the tent flapped in the wind.

I packed my sack and was soon making my way past the water falls at
Pont y Cyfnyg and up the farm track towards the mountain. As I gained
height I could see the tops of the Carneddau were covered in
snow. Earlier in the day I glimpsed a covering of snow on Siabod
through breaks in the cloud. However, it appeared to have melted
during the day. As I climbed up the huge grey clouds began to disperse
and soon there ere large blue patches everywhere. Visibility was
excellent, the rain and cold air ensuring there was no haze to obscure
the views.

I intended to climb the Ddear Ddu ridge, so turned left at the ladder
style at the end of the farm track. I mad my way through the old
quarry workings and climbed up to the small col above llyn y
Foel. Dropping down towards the lake the ground was very wet. By
weaving about and some tussock hopping I avoided getting my feet too
wet. I could see someone at the bottom of the Ddear Ddu ridge, but
this was the only person I saw all day. I stopped to fill my Platypus
bottles from the lake before beginning the ascent. Although the rock
was wet, it didn't seem greasy. I kept close to the right hand side of
the ridge, to enjoy the exposure. The ridge always seems longer than
it looks from below. Not that it matters, as the climbing is so
enjoyable. Eventually I arrived at the final rocks below the summit
cairn and made my way onto the summit ridge so I could enjoy the views
over the far side. There was a stiff breeze and it felt very cold.

I was keen to get the tent up quickly and chose to pitch on the
slightly sloping grass platform on the South East side of the summit,
where I had pitched with my daughter. Unfortunately, I pitched a
little too far up the slope and wasn't able to get a good taut pitch,
as the ground wasn't level enough. As it was very cold I didn't want
to take the tent down and move it, so I decided it would do. I chucked
all my gear into the tent and began to make tea. On overnighters I
alternate between eating Bewell Hot Cereal Start and Porridge with
Sultanas. Since it's only an evening meal and a breakfast it doesn't
get too boring. Although dehydrated food has come a long way since my
1976 trip to Scandanavia, the only varieties I really enjoy are the
porridge and Hot Cereal Start. Stupidly I had forgotten my pot cosy,
so has to add a little extra hot water just before eating my meal, as
it had cooled down quite a bit.

It was now almost sunset, so I had a walk around the summit and took
some photos. The wind was very cold and I was only just warm enough
with all the layers I had brought with me. I dived back into the tent,
where my thermometer showed it was only 2.5C. The angle of the slope
was just enough for me to slide down my Exped UL Synmat. Eventually,
stuck a load of gear at the end of the tent and wedged my feet against
it to stop me sliding. It brought back memories of a bivouac near to
the summit of the Matterhorn many years ago. There are lots of ledges
on the Matterhorn, but most of them slope outwards. During the night I
kept sliding down the ledge and ending up being brought up sharp by
the rope. At least this time I was warm. On the Matterhorn I had no
sleeping bag and the night was spent shivering violently until that
warmed me up and slithering down the ledge.

Looking out of my tent at first light the ground was white over. At
first it appeared as though the summit was misted out, but it was only
a very thin layer and it soon dispersed to give excellent views. I had
a feeling that the good weather might not last, so after a quick
breakfast began to pack away. I was just taking the tent down when a
brief snow storm blew in, to make the job more difficult. It soon
cleared and I began to make my way back down towards the Eastern ridge. I
traversed below the rocky crest, wanting to avoid the ice glazed rock
while carrying a relatively heavy sack.

I was soon making my way down the series of depressions in the North East
ridge, which lead back to the farm track. Part of the way down the
track, I met a group of young people trudging up hill bent under the
weight of huge rucksacks.

Arriving back at the car I drove over to Llanberis for the traditional
cholesterol overload at Pete's Eats. When I emerged from the cafe, I
could see that I had been right about the weather and all the summits
were again misted out and it was drizzling steadily. It had been a
great trip and I was very lucky to get a short window of good weather
in the current dreary conditions.
