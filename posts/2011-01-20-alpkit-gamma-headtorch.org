I am a bit of a head torch addict. Over the years I have had a number
of different ones - mostly from Petzl. These include the original
Petzl Zoom, which used the old flat batteries and an updated version
which used AA batteries. These accompanied me on many Alpine and
Scottish winter trips. However, the battery life was limited, which
meant carrying heavy spares. In the case of the original Zoom the
connections could often be a bit dodgy, which meant disassembling the
torch in the dark in freezing cold to get it working again.

Fast forward 20 years or so and most head torches have LED
lights. They may not be quite as bright as the original torches, but
they run off AAA batteries, which means carrying spare batteries
doesn't have a significant weight penalty. Battery life is much
greater than the original Petzl Zoom and reliability seems
significantly better.

I already have a Petzl eLite, which lives in the car. Last year I
bought a Petzl ???. One reason for choosing this particular torch is
the red LED. This is useful outside when I don't want to
destroy my night vision. I also use the red LED at home, or on
holiday. I tend to get up much earlier than the rest of the family and
I can switch on the torch to see what I am doing without disturbing
anyone else.

However, it's usually in the wrong place. I use it at night when
I go outside to find the cats, or check on the buildings, but I also
keep it in the bedroom when I am asleep. Thus it's usually downstairs
when I want it upstairs or vice-versa. The obvious solution was to buy
yet another head torch, keeping one upstairs and one
downstairs. However, Petzl head torches are not cheap. Luckily I
discovered the Alpkit [[http://www.alpkit.com/shop/cart.php?target%3Dproduct&product_id%3D16345&category_id%3D253][Gamma]] . I have bought a few things from Alpkit
and been very happy with their products and service. The Gamma has
white, green and red LED's with a strobe mode for emergencies. There
is another red LED at the back of the battery box, which can also be
set to strobe. All this is an amazing £12.50 delivered, including
three Duracell AAA batteries.

I bought one just before Christmas and am delighted with it. I have
used the main beam when cycling, with the rear LED in flashing mode a
couple of times and at the speed I go there is plenty of illumination
on dark country lanes. It doesn't have the sliding filter over the
lens to switch between spot and flood modes that the Petzl has, but i
don't miss this. In fact I generally prefer it to my Petzl.
