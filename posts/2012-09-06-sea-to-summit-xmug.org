I managed to crack my plastic mug and was about to buy another one
when I decided to investigate the alternatives. I don't like metal
mugs of any sort. I end up burning my finger and lips whenever I use
them. Mugs take up space in my rucksack. I can try to stuff things
inside them to try and reduce the dead space, but this isn't always
possible.

I had read several reviews of Sea to Summits [[http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/71][X-Mug]] . It's constructed
from silicone with a rigid rim. Its unique selling point is that it
collapses into a flat disc. It holds around 500ml and the rim
around the top prevents scalded fingers. I had a couple of concerns
about it. Firstly I wondered how stable it was, I didn't want it
collapsing in the tent when it was full of a hot drink. Secondly some
reviewers said that it retained the taste of the previous
contents. However, several other people said that they hadn't found
this to be a problem.

I nipped into my local [[http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com][Cotswold]] to have a look at one. After
examining one I was happy that it wouldn't collapse accidentally. I
decided to take a chance that it wouldn't retain the taste of any
previous contents and bought one. When I got it home I tried several
drink in it and confirm that after washing it doesn't retain the
taste of the previous contents. It was find with hot drinks, I didn't
scale either my fingers or my mouth. Drinks do cool down a bit faster
than in my old plastic beaker. However, this is an advantage for me
as I like to have my hot drink as soon as I have made it and it
doesn't stay in the cup long enough to get cold!
