I haven't included what I would be wearing, which would usually
include a Rab Vapour Ride Lite jacket. In hot weather this would go
inside the rucksack. In warm weather I wear Rab Treklite trousers. In
cooler weather I wear my Mammut Base Jumps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is what I would typically take on a Spring/Autumn trip. In
summer, if the forecast was good, I wouldn't take either the cagoule,
or the waterproof over trousers, but would substitute either a Montane
???? or Marmot Dr-Clime windshirt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I prefer to camp high up, so it's usually chilly in the evening and
early mornings. The Montane prism jacket, worn over my base layer
keeps me nice and warm. The Montane prism trousers
&lt;/p&gt;

Last year I bought a Giant Defy 2. However, I didn't want to ride it
through all the mud and salt in the winter months, so decided to buy a
cheap bike to use in winter. I did quite a bit of research and decided
to get a Decathlon Triban 500 SE. There is a more detailed review of the Triban 500SE
&lt;a href="http://road.cc/content/review/116333-btwin-triban-500-se-road-bike"&gt;road.cc&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had to go into Decathlon with my daughter to buy some skiing
equipment and had  chance to look at the 500SE. It seemed to be a
decent bike for the price and I had read several positive reviews. I
ended up coming out of the store with one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decathlon Triban 500SE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2015-03_triban/IMG_20150203_132015.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Decathlon Triban 500SE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2015-03_triban/IMG_20150203_132015.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
After a few local rides of between 20 and 40 miles I was quite
impressed. The microshift gears (3x8) weren't as smooth a the Tiagra
on the Giant, but changes were positive with no missed gears. I have
got used to a compact gear set on the Giant, which I prefer to the
more traditional three front rings. However, there isn't anything
around here that's steep enough for me to need the small front ring,
so it wasn't really a problem. The saddle was a bit uncomfortable
after a couple of hours riding. However, it can't be that bad as I have a
better spare saddle at home and I haven't bothered changing it yet! The carbon
fork absorbs road vibrations nicely. The brakes do their job of
stopping you with minimum fuss, but I needed to pull a bit harder than
on the Giant.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I did change the tyres for Schwalbe Durano Plus folding tyres, as most
of my riding is along country lanes, where punctures from hedge
cuttings are common.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having ridden it for a couple of months the freewheel packed up about
5 miles from home. I had to call out International Rescue and put the
bike in the boot of the car. Decathlon didn't have any freewheels in
stock, so gave me a complete new wheel. Definitely excellent customer
service. They showed me the broken freewheel which had rusted and the
bearings were badly worn on the drive side. I wash my bike after every
ride in the winter and am careful not to get detergent or GT85
anywhere near bearings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rear cassette after 1500 miles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2015-03_triban/IMG_20150224_164314.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Rear cassette after 1500 miles"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2015-03_triban/IMG_20150224_164314.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
After 1500 miles the gears began to skip. Measuring the chain it didn't appear
unduly worn. However, the teeth on the cassette looked just like
sharks teeth! My LBS replaced the cassette and chain, plus the cables.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what's the final verdict. Overall I am happy with the Triban. I
enjoy riding it and I don't worry too much it getting plastered in
muck and grit. For the price it's a good buy, but don't expect the
drive chain to be as durable as a more expensive bike.

I prefer gas for cooking and my stove of choice is the Primus
Gravity. This is a remote canister stove, with a pre-heater, which
makes it suitable for use in colder weather. Almost all my camping
cooking is just a matter of boiling water to make a hot drink, or
prepare a freeze dried meal.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I have looked at Jetboil stoves, but decided that they weren't for me
because they were too heavy and the long tall shape makes them
potentially unstable. However, if I needed to melt snow they would
probably be my primary choice. One thing I haven't seen other
manufacturers make is a cooking pot with a heat exchanger on the
bottom, which could potentially improve the performance of a normal
gas stove. However, &lt;a href="https://www.alpkit.com/products/brupot"&gt;Alpkit&lt;/a&gt; have now made a cooking pot with built in
heat exchanger. I decided to buy one with the hope that it would
reduce the time it takes to boil water on my stove and potentially
save gas.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alpkit BruPot test setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2014-10-Brukit/IMG_20141004_160215.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Alpkit BruPot test setup"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2014-10-Brukit/IMG_20141004_160215.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
The Brupot was delivered with the typical rapid efficiency. I wanted
to compare it to my MSR stainless steel kettle, which is my usual
cooking pot. Both vessels hold 1 litre of liquid, but the Brupot is
slightly slimmer and therefore narrower. The Brupot has a plastic detachable
lid, with a drinking slot so you can use it as a cup. It has
detachable handles, which are covered in plastic so you don't burn
your hands. There is a tightly fitting neoprene sleeve, which acts as
a pot cosy. However, Alpkit recommends that you remove this when
cooking. Since the sleeve is a tight fit, it's effectively
useless. Can you image trying to fit a tight sleeve round a pot full
of boiling water without burning your hands?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alpkit BruPot and MSR kettle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2014-10-Brukit/IMG_20141006_165911.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Alpkit BruPot and MSR kettle"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2014-10-Brukit/IMG_20141006_165911.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do a head to head to see how long each pot would take to
boil 500ml of water. I used my Primus stove with a full 500g
canister. The test was conducted in the kitchen, so I didn't bother
using a wind shield. I adjusted the flame on the stove so it didn't
come round the sides of the pot and I didn't alter the flame setting when
I swapped the pans. Each pan was filled with 500ml of cold water from
the tap and placed on the stove.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I measured the time it took a continuous jet of steam to appear, which
should correspond to a rolling boil. I didn't take the top off either
pan off while it was heating the water, as this would increase the
time to get a rolling boil. Thus there may have been a small error in
judging when a pot was actually boiling. Also I didn't conduct another
test with no lids on the pots, which would have made it easier to see
if there was a rolling boil, as this isn't the way I use the pot when
camping. I repeated the test three times. Between each set of repeat experiments
I turned off the gas, then re-lit the stove , so the times for each
run can't be summed to give an average, as the gas flow was probably
different for each run.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Much to my surprise the Alpkit BruPot was slower to reach a rolling
boil than the MSR, by about ten seconds in each test. That's not a big
difference, but I was expecting the BruPot to be significantly faster
because of the heat exchanger. I like the BruPot and it will probably
replace my MSR kettle, because the handles and top are
better. However, it seems that the heat exchanger doesn't work for my
use case.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Alpkit Brupot weighs 266g, including the bag and my MSR kettle
weighs 254g.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgf1dd881" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgf1dd881"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;[2014-10-07 Tue] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Update.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1dd881"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was pointed out to me that I really should also be measuring the
weight of gas used. In my original experiment I didn't weight the gas
canister. I believe my conclusions were valid as I didn't alter the
gas flow between swapping pots and I was starting with a full 500g
canister, so I would have expected flow to remain almost constant, so
the weight of gas consumed would be the same. Also in the second run I
swapped the order of the pots in the test, which should have shown up
any differences caused by changes in gas flow between tests. In both
cases the MSR boiled faster.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, in the interests of accuracy I repeated my experiment and
weighed the gas canister at the beginiing and end of each test.The
first time I did this I kept the canister attached to the stove and
stood the canister on top of the scales. I didn't alter the setting of
the valve between pots, but did note the weight of the canister before
and after the pot boiled. I did two separate runs, restarting the
stove for each run.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Water was from the cold tap, which was allowed to flow for a couple of
minutes first, so all the water used shuld have had the same starting temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whilst I believe that the boil &lt;b&gt;times&lt;/b&gt; are comparable within each run,
the effect of the hose attached to the top of the canister meant that
the &lt;b&gt;weights&lt;/b&gt; probably were not accurate. So, I repeated the whole
thing again, but this time removed the gas canister from the pipe
before weighing it. Since when I re-lighted the stove, I couldn't be
certain that I was using the same flow rate I believe that the &lt;b&gt;times&lt;/b&gt;
for this set of results are not comparable, but the &lt;b&gt;weight of gas&lt;/b&gt;
consumed is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8da9600"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The difference in performance between the BruPot and the MSR kettle
are quite small and probably have little effect in real world use. The
only real surprise is that in my setup the hest exchanger doesn't seem
to have any positive effect. However, I still like the Alpkit BruPot
and one advantage over my MSR is I can fit a 200g gas canister inside
it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>review</category><guid>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2014-10-06-Alpkit%20BruPot/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 17:58:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Montane Prism</title><link>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2014-01-05-Montane-Prism/</link><dc:creator>Ian Barton.</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
This review is all about a trio of Montane Prisms!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org5512798" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org5512798"&gt;Prism Jacket.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5512798"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Prism jacket has been around for a while and is now at
version 2. The outer is Pertex microlight and it's filled with 40g of
Primaloft. For those of you that don't know Primaloft is best
described as artificial down. Weight for weight down will keep you
warmer than Primaloft. However, Primaloft doesn't clump when it gets
wet unlike down, which then loses most of its insulating
properties. Hence Primaloft is usually more suitable for the British
climate, where it's more often damp and cold unlike the cold dry
weather in an Alpine environment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what sort of British conditions is the jacket useful for? It's not
really a full on Scottish winter belay jacket, although you could use
it under a hard shell. It's more of a three season cold/windy
jacket. The Pertex outer is water resistant and will keep out
persistent drizzle, but not a full on downpour. However, if it does
get completely soaked it dries out quickly. Even in summer it's useful
as something to wear at rest stops or at night when camping. My size L
only weighs 445g, so it's not too heavy if you are carrying it in your
rucsack most of the time. It will pack into its own pocket, taking
up very little space in your rucksack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am 6ft 2" with a 38" chest. The large size fits me with some room to
spare inside and it's long enough to cover my body. I often find that
medium sized jackets fit me, but aren't long enough. The Prism has a
slight drop tail, so will help stop the small of you back getting cold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On to the details. The pockets are padded with Primaloft, which makes
them good for hand warming. They are positioned fairly high up, so are
accessible if you are wearing a waist strap or climbing harness. The
cuffs are elasticated keeping out the wind and moisture. There is some
soft material inside the zip flap at the head end. This acts as a
beard guard and even if you don't have a beard will stop your neck and
lips chafing against the material. The full sized hood has a good
volume adjuster, which makes it a comfortable fit with or without a
helmet. I am not always a fan of hoods, often preferring a hat, but I
like this hood.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In use I have found the jacket both warm and very breathable. I have used it
for cycling in temperatures between freezing and about 6C over a
lightweight Merino top. I didn't overheat or find sweat building up
inside the jacket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org1361d30" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org1361d30"&gt;Prism Gilet.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1361d30"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have got a couple of other gilets. A Marmot Driclime, which is
excellent for warmer weather and a Paramo Torres. I wear the Torres
almost every day at home between Autumn and Summer. It's very and very
robust. However, it's not particularly light (???g) and doesn't pack
down very small. Thus it's good if you actually wear it all day, but
not so good if you are carrying it in your rucksack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I picked up a Montane Prism gilet. Like the jacket this is
filled with Primaloft and the pockets are also Primaloft filled. Also
like the jacket it packs away in its own pocket. I can see myself
using the gilet a lot from Spring to Autumn worn over a base layer and
with my Rab Vapour Rise Lite jacket. Combined with my Montane Lite
Speed jacket as an outer layer, these three layers should keep me
comfortable in most conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgbae0e43" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgbae0e43"&gt;Prism Trousers.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbae0e43"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a long walk carrying a rucksack when I finally set up camp I
find that if my legs get cold I end up with bad attacks of cramp. I
usually sleep in some thin long johns, to help keep my sleeping bag
clean, but if I am just lounging around inside the tent these aren't
warm enough.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have been looking around for something warmer than long johns, that
don't weigh much and could also be used to boost my sleeping bag's
insulation in winter. Montane's Prism Pants seemed to a good
choice. Initially, I had reservations. I have got a pair of Montane
Terra trousers, which even in the large size are way too short for my
legs. For some reason Montane seem to make their trousers shorter than
other manufacturers. However,  I needn't have worried as they were
long enough. They pack down into a small stuff sack an my size L weigh
318g. There are short zips at the bottom of the legs and a number of
press stud fastenings,which let you cinch up the bottoms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are no pockets or fly zip. However, for my intended use this
isn't a problem. The Rab photon trousers have full length zips, a fly
zip, more Primaloft and have pockets.  There are also reinforced seat,
knees and kick patches. However, they are considerably
heavier at 550g for the L size. Most of the additional features are
only of use if you intend to wear them all day an while the extra
Primaloft makes them warmer, the Prisms should be warm enough for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>review</category><guid>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2014-01-05-Montane-Prism/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2014 17:56:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fire Steel Disappears Into A Pile Of Dust</title><link>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2013-02-18-Fire-Steel-Disappears-Into-a-Pile-of-Dust/</link><dc:creator>Ian Barton.</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
After my walk over Moel Famau and Moel Arthur I was looking forward
to making a hot drink. My brew kit lives permanently in the boot of
the truck, so I don't forget to take it with me! I unpacked my Primus
Gravity stove from its pouch and connected up a gas cylinder.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use a
Light My Fire &lt;a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/products/sparking-fire-collection/swedish-firesteel-20.aspx"&gt;Swedish Fire Steel&lt;/a&gt; rather than matches or a
lighter. This will generate a spark under almost any conditions and
doesn't run out of gas, or refuse to light when soggy, like lighters
and, matches. I keep it in a small zipped section of the pouch that
the stove lives in. I pulled it out, so I coud light the stove and
noticed that the steel was now only about half an inch long! I
thought that it must have somehow got broken, but looking inside the
pouch there was nothing but a pile of grey dust. Luckily there was
just enough left to generate a spark and light my stove.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I got home I spent some time Googling and found that other
people had had similar problems: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pfZAcPq3o"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there was a possible
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhPyig4ra40"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt; . It would appear that contact with inorganic salts and
water can make the fire steel, which is made from an alloy called
Ferrocerium, can act as a battery. This results in the fire steel
corroding away. The bag containing my steel may well have been
slightly damp, but as far as I know it hadn't come into contact with
any salt solutions unless something spilt on the bag had soaked through.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, lesson learned. Always check your fire steel before setting
out. Even something you think couldn't possibly fail can do so in an
unexpected way.

I have been a fan of Rab's Vapour Rise clothing for a while. The
trousers (pants if you are from the US) are my leg wear of choice in
the cooler seasons. They are breathable

I managed to crack my plastic mug and was about to buy another one
when I decided to investigate the alternatives. I don't like metal
mugs of any sort. I end up burning my finger and lips whenever I use
them. Mugs take up space in my rucksack. I can try to stuff things
inside them to try and reduce the dead space, but this isn't always
possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sea to Summit X-Mug&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/X-Mug.jpg" title="A title" class="rounded float-left" alt="Sea to Summit X-Mug"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/X-Mug.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I had read several reviews of Sea to Summits &lt;a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/71"&gt;X-Mug&lt;/a&gt; . It's constructed
from silicone with a rigid rim. Its unique selling point is that it
collapses into a flat disc. It holds around 500ml and the rim
around the top prevents scalded fingers. I had a couple of concerns
about it. Firstly I wondered how stable it was, I didn't want it
collapsing in the tent when it was full of a hot drink. Secondly some
reviewers said that it retained the taste of the previous
contents. However, several other people said that they hadn't found
this to be a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I nipped into my local &lt;a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com"&gt;Cotswold&lt;/a&gt; to have a look at one. After
examining one I was happy that it wouldn't collapse accidentally. I
decided to take a chance that it wouldn't retain the taste of any
previous contents and bought one. When I got it home I tried several
drink in it and confirm that after washing it doesn't retain the
taste of the previous contents. It was find with hot drinks, I didn't
scale either my fingers or my mouth. Drinks do cool down a bit faster
than in my old plastic beaker. However, this is an advantage for me
as I like to have my hot drink as soon as I have made it and it
doesn't stay in the cup long enough to get cold!

I have often wondered how cold it got inside and outside my tent
during the night. My Casio Protrek watch has a thermometer. However,
this has a couple of disadvantages. Firstly the sensor is on the side
of the watch, so if you are wearing it on your wrist it just measures
your external body temperature. Secondly, it only shows the current
temperature and not the maximum or minimum.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solar Thermometer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/solar_thermometer.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Solar Thermometer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/solar_thermometer.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
If you have a greenhouse, you are probably familiar with the "U"
shaped spirit thermometer, which has a metal cylinder on each column
to indicate the min and max temperature. These aren't very practical
to carry around in your rucksack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I saw a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Solar-Digital-Window-Thermometer-Greenhouse/dp/B004Z00Z56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1328887573&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Digital Solar Thermometer&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon. This displays
the current temperature and the minimum and maximum. It's small and
only weighs 15g. You can choose to display the temperature in either
Celsius or Fahrenheit and there is a reset button, which resets the
min and max display. As far as I can tell, the min and max will be
reset after 24hrs automatically. Checking the temperature against
another digital thermometer it seems to be accurate.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>review</category><guid>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2012-02-10-solar-maximum-and-minimum-thermometer/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 17:53:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Exped Synmat Ultralite</title><link>https://ianbarton.co.uk/posts/2011-09-01-exped-synmat-ultralite/</link><dc:creator>Ian Barton.</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I am a big fan of my Thermarest Neoair, which is very comfortable,
light and packs down small. However, I find that I tend to roll off it
when I am asleep. Recently I needed to buy another light weight mat
for one of the family. Rather than just buy another Neoair, I did some
research and discovered the &lt;a href="http://www.facewest.co.uk/Exped-SynMat-Ultralite.html"&gt;Exped Synmat Ultralite&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Like the Neoair the Synmat is an inflatable, but there are significant
differences. The Neoair relies on internal baffles, which prevent
convection, to achieve its insulation. The Synmat is filled with
Primaloft, which is laminated to the walls. This prevents the filling
from migrating and allows for greater loft.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Neoair uses a single valve for both inflation and deflation, but
the Synmat has two separate one way valves. Most people inflate the
Neoair by mouth. You can inflate the Synmat the same way, but moisture
from your breath will eventually compromise the effectiveness of the
Primaloft. Exped sell a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGIi7Of2ZFU"&gt;pillow pump&lt;/a&gt; , which functions both as a pillow
filled with expanding foam and an air pump. I decided to buy a pillow
pump, which works well both as a pump and a very comfortable pillow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is one other important difference in construction between the
Synmat and the Neoair. The inflatable tubes in the Neoair run
horizontally, whilst those in the Synmat run vertically along the
length of the mat. The outer tubes of the Synmat are slightly larger
than the inner tubes, which makes it harder to roll off the mat.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So how do the two mats compare for sleeping on? I haven't tested
either mat in really cold conditions, but both kept me warm. Note the
Synmat has a slightly higher R value, so in theory should provide
better insulation. Both mats require about the same effort to inflate
and pack down to a very similar size. However, I did find the Synmat
slightly more comfortable than the Neoair and more importantly I
didn't roll off the Synmat during the night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Neoair feels quite flimsy compared to the Synmat, but I haven't
had a problem with punctures. A nice detail is that the Synmat comes
with a repair kit, whereas you have to buy one for the Neoair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So which do I prefer? It's a very close call, I like both mats and
compared to other types of sleeping mat like my old Karrimat, or self
inflating mats, they are streets ahead in terms of comfort, lightness
and pack size. I marginally prefer the Synmat as I find it slightly
more comfortable and so far I haven't rolled off it.
&lt;/p&gt;

I had wanted to try my Zephyros for some time, but hadn't had an
opportunity to take it into the mountains. The weather had settled
into the pattern of recent years, with a dry Spring, but wet and
unsettled weather throughout the Summer. However, a brief window of
opportunity was forecast mid-week with bad weather clearing in the
afternoon, followed by a brighter day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llyn y Foel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had hoped to use one of the routes over the Arans from &lt;a href="http://v-g.me.uk"&gt;v-g's&lt;/a&gt;
site. However, it didn't look as though the good weather would last
long enough. So, I decided on a late afternoon ascent of Moel Siabod
from Capel Curig, camping near to the summit and returning to Capel
early the next morning. It was school holidays (which probably
explains the bad weather), so I persuaded one of my daughters (Ella)
that camping on top of a mountain in dodgy weather was a good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;View from Ddear Ddu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driving over the Llandegla Moors, rain began to pour down from the
grey skies, so much for the promised clear weather in the
afternoon. When we reached the A5, it had stopped raining, but the sky
was entirely covered in low grey clouds. Driving up from Betwys y Coed
I caught occasional glimpses of the summit of Siabod trough the
cloud. It wasn't raining continuously, but there were frequent heavy
showers. We had tea in the Pinnacle cafe in Capel Curig before driving
back to the car park near to the Bryn y Glo cafe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ella at the top of the Ddear Ddu ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2011-08-08_moel_siabod/08082011173_1.jpg" class="rounded

&lt;p&gt;
Ella sat in the car while I packed the rucksack in the rain. When we
set off the sky was covered in low grey cloud and it was raining
intermittently. I glanced over the bridge at Pont y ??? and noticed
that the level of water in the river was well up for the time of
year. After a short distance we turned right and started up the steep
farm track, following the diversion that takes the path away from the
farm buildings. As we made our way along the track over the moors, I
could see that the summit of Siabod was covered in cloud. Rather than
try and camp on the summit, I decided that we would be better off
camping next to Llyn y Foel and hope that the weather was better in
the morning..
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking towards the Rhinogs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was Ella's first trip up Siabod and I was regretting not waiting
for better conditions. Also, her boots were leaking badly and since
the path was running with water, her feet were soon soaked. We made
our way up through the old quarry workings and stopped to stare into a
couple of the flooded workings. On a sunny day the water appears in
vivid colours, caused by the different dissolved minerals. However,
today it just looked grey, like the sky above.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking NE along the summit ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2011-08-08_moel_siabod/09082011176_1.jpg" class="rounded

&lt;p&gt;
As we approached Llyn y Foel a few breaks appeared in the clouds and
the summit cleared. After a bit of deliberation we decided to continue
over the Ddear Ddu ridge to the summit. Unfortunately, the path past Llyn
y Foel was very boggy and Ella's feet got even wetter. The Ddear Ddu ridge was
a pleasant scramble, but needed care as the rock was quite
greasy. Also I was hampered by carrying a heavy pack. I made my way
slowly up the ridge, with Ella skipping along behind like a faun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zephyros below the summit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2011-08-08_moel_siabod/09082011178_1.jpg" class="rounded

&lt;p&gt;
I could see the clouds racing over the summit and wondered how windy
it was going to be on top. The forecast was for winds gusting up to
45mph, but falling back to 25mph later in the day. By the time we had
reached the final rocks below the summit, the cloud had risen some way
above the summit and there were some large patches of blue sky
appearing. Once we got onto the summit ridge it was very windy and
Ella sat in the summit shelter, covered by my bothy bag, while I went
in search of a suitable spot to pitch the tent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloudy early morning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2011-08-08_moel_siabod/09082011181_1.jpg" class="rounded

&lt;p&gt;
There is a nice flat area to the North of the summit, which has great
views over Snowdon and the Glyders, where I pitched the tent on my
 last trip. However, it was exposed to the full force of the westerly
wind, which was blowing me about and was definitely not the place to
pitch the tent. I back tracked to the area on the southern slope, just below
the summit ridge, where I found a nice flat area close to the summit
cairn.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SE ridge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/2011-08-08_moel_siabod/09082011182_1.jpg" class="rounded

&lt;p&gt;
I unpacked the Zephyros and had it pitched in less than 10 minutes. I
climbed back up to the summit shelter and fetched Ella and we put all
our gear into the tent. The Zephyros 2 is very cosy for two and you
can only just fit two sleeping mats side by side. It was now about
8:30pm and the light was fading. I found it was possible to cook in
the porch, but you really need to have the flysheet open to avoid
setting light to the tent! After a cup of hot chocolate and some
porridge and sultanas, we settled down for the night. Contrary to the
forecast the wind didn't drop at all during the night. We could hear
the roar of the gale on the other side of the summit ridge and blasts
of wind that made it over the ridge rattled the Zephyros. However, the
tent stood up to the wind and sharp showers during the night without
any problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early morning storm clouds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The wind kept us awake most of the night and we dropped off to sleep
about 4:00pm, waking again about 6:30am. Wisps of cloud were blowing
over the summit and the wind hadn't dropped at all during the
night. After a cup of hot chocolate we decide to pack up and go down
to the valley for breakfast. We crossed over to the northern side of
the summit ridge and dropped down below the crest, to avoid scrambling
over the rocks. We were now exposed to the full force of the wind. I
was being buffeted and Ella was struggling to stay on her feet. I
could see sheets of rain blowing along the Ogwen Valley over Capel
Curig. Luckily, although we were exposed to the gale, the rain showers
passed us by. It felt much more like Autumn than early August.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally out of the gale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once we started dropping down the southern slopes we were sheltered
from the wind and made quick progress down the eroded path back to
the end of the track. We got back to the car about 9:00am and went
straight round to Pete's Eats for breakfast!
&lt;/p&gt;
