Mynydd Mawr is an outlier of the Moel Hebog group and is situated
between Snowdon and the Nantlle Ridge. It's not very high - 698m or
2269ft, but because of it's position the views from the top are
spectacular.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking NW from Mynydd Mawr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

float-left" alt="Looking NW from Mynydd Mawr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/DSCF1301.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Most people start from Rhyd Ddu, the route going past the Craig y
Bera, which has the excellent climb Angel Pavement. However, we were
staying in the adjacent valley at &lt;a href="http://www.tycochsnowdonia.co.uk/"&gt;Hen Ysgubor&lt;/a&gt;, which is at the foot of
the mountain, so that's where I started my climb.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craig Cwm Du&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/DSCF1304.JPG" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Craig Cwm Du"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/DSCF1304.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Please note that you can't follow the exact route I describe unless
you are staying in the house, as it crosses farmland belonging to the
house. However, it's possible to start on the road between Waunfawr
and Rhosgadfan (SH  514583).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Hen Ysgubor I walked up the fields behind the house to reach the
edge of the trees at approximately 532566.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/DSCF1311.JPG" class="rounded
float-left" alt=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://ianbarton.co.uk/galleries/DSCF1311.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
From the top of the first steep rise trending generally left brings
you out to a stone wall at !!!!! It's possible to cross the wall in
the corner of the field via the stone sheepfold (528559) by going
through the holes under the wall. There are also several big flat
stones on top of the wall at various points. If you are very careful
not to damage the wall, you can climb over the wall.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The track up the Eastern slope (not marked on the map) of the mountain
is obvious from here. There is a steep pull up to some old mine
workings, surrounded by a fence (be careful not to fall in). The path
continues steeply upwards and contours along the edge of Craig Cwm
Du. These vegetated cliffs provide some good Winter climbs in
suitable, but rare, conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you reach the top the path becomes fainter and you need to bear
right. In poor visibility you will probably need to use your
compass. It seems a long pull up to the summit, which isn't visible
until your are about a hundred yards away. However, once you get there
the views are stunning. Like Moel Siabod, Mynydd Mawr is an isolated
summit and so provides extensive views of the other peaks. On one side
you have the Nantlle Ridge and on the other Snowdon and the
Glyders. There are also good views over Caernarfon and Anglesey.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the summit you can descend to Rhydd Ddu, or simply retrace your steps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nantlle Ridge from Mynydd Mawr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had passed the Clwydian range hundreds of times on the way to
Snowdonia, but I had never climbed any of its hills. Amongst other
things the hills are famous for the range of iron Age hill forts, with
six forts along the crest of the ridge. The crest of the ridge is
heather moorland and Offa's Dyke path follows almost the entire ridge.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The weather forecast predicted a cold, clear day, so I decided to
Cilcain for a walk up Moel Arthur and then along the ridge to Moel
Famau, the highest top.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had found an interesting route that traversed the ridge from Moel
Arhtur to Moel Famau on the &lt;a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/2509/"&gt;Walking Britain&lt;/a&gt; website. I drove to the
start of the route in Cilcain, which is just off the main Mold to
Denbigh road. I stopped briefly in the car park opposite the church
which has a notice stating "The gate may be locked at any timeâ. The
Walking Britain site suggests that you drive down the lane next to the
church over a stream and park near to the tree by the large grey steel
framed building, so that's what I did. There was quite a bit of space
and only one other car there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I parked up and started heating some water for a flask using my new
Primus Gravity II stove. I was using a Coleman's gas cylinder, which
is a propane/butane mix, so even though the temperature wasn't much
above freezing the water was soon boiling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the car I walked back into Cilcain and then took the path
opposite the church running North West on the right hand side of the
car park. I followed the path over a few stiles and arrived at a small
lane. On the way I passed several clumps of snowdrops, a nice sign
that Spring can't be too far away. Careful study of the map showed
that I need to turn left, walk a few yards and then follow a small
lane off to the right down a hill.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I followed the lane until reached a T junction, where I climbed over
the stile directly in front of me. The path continued in more or less
a straight line over several fields. When I reached a small wood on
the left, I went diagonally to the right hand corner of the
field. There I had a short chat with two people hanging a gate. I
wasn't sure about the way ahead, but there was a yellow waymark
pointing along the line of the fence to the left. I continued along
the line of the fence, through some very boggy ground and crossed the
stream via some convenient stones without getting my feet wet. I
turned left, expecting to find a gate after a short distance. However,
there was a new looking fence made from pig netting and barbed, with
no apparent way through. I walked backwards and forwards along the
fence a couple of times, but couldn't find an easy way over or
through. Luckily, I found an empty feed bucket and by standing on top
of this I was able to get over the fence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I crossed the field and found the stile in the hedge by the road at
grid ref. SJ162670.  I climbed over the stile and went in a generally
leftwards direction to cross over a stream. Once over the stream, I
followed the path straight up the hill into the corner of the wood. I
continued along the path straight ahead for a short distance and then
took the forestry track to the left, which led uphill. This lead to a
gate at grid ref. SJ156677, with a wooden horse jump to its left. I
climbed over the jump and turned left along the wide path, which
skirted the woods to my left. The views from the path were extensive,
as I was on the crest of a ridge. Eventually, the path started to drop
down towards the car park at grid ref. 147657. I should have turned
right here and carried on up the eastern slope of Moel Arthur to the
summit, but I carried on along the path. About two thirds of the way
down to the car park I realized my mistake, so I cut directly back up
the side of Moel Arthur to the summit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After taking a few photos I made my way back down the slope to the car
park, which was quite busy. I crossed the road and started to make my
way directly up the hill opposite. The path goes up through a small
gully, which was still full of snow. I stopped just below the snow and
had a chat with a man who was in the process of putting on a pair of
small crampons. I reached the snow, which turned out to be iron hard
neve. Luckily there was a ladder of steps and the slope was short.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once I reached the ridge there were views of Snowdon, Cadair Idris,
the North Wales coast. I could see snow on the peaks on Snowdonia, but
Cader seemed to be snow free. I followed the path along the crest of
the ridge towards Moel Famau. I wished that I had brought my
binoculars to help me identify all the towns, buildings and hills I
could see. Out to the West were the mountains of Snowdonia, whilst
over to the East most of Merseyside was clearly visible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to be back home by 4:00pm and I wasn't sure how long it would
take me to get back to the car, so I didn't stop until I got to the
Jubilee Tower on Moel Famau. Apparently, this was built to celebrate
the 50th year of George III's reign, but it was never completed. I sat
under the North side of the tower, which was sheltered from the breeze
and ate my lunch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the tower I walked short distance to the North East. Once away
from the shelter of the tower I was exposed to the very cold North
Easterly breeze. I joined the descent path, which dropped down steeply
North Eastwards along the left hand side of a wood and once I reached
the wood I was sheltered from the cold wind. I reached a small finger
post where my path crossed a track. I carried straight on down hill
making for the left hand side of the reservoir below. Following the
path beside the reservoir, I reached a gate at the end of the lane.
Walking along the lane brought me out next to the car. It was 2:30pm,
so I just had time to make another cup of hot chocolate before I set
off for home.

I have wanted to visit the Berwyns for some time. Although we live
quite close and I have been to Snowdonia  many times, I have never
walked in there. Reading through the Nuttall's book the Cadair
Berwyn horseshoe seemed to be the best walk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although the weather had been quite sunny for most of the week, it was
raining as I drove past Oswestey. I arrived at Llanrheader y Mochnant
and spent some time looking at the map trying to work out exactly how
to get to Cwm Maen Gwynedd. Eventually I worked out that I needed to
go back into the centre of the village and take a sharp right past the
pub. A short distance further on I had to reverse back to make the
very sharp left turn onto the road leading into Cwm Maen Gwynedd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I drove up the valley on the look out for the farm called Tyn y Ffrid
where the walk started. I hadn't realized that there were two farms with
that name in the valley. Eventually I worked out that the walk started
at the second farm near to an old red telephone box. There was a large
"No Parking" notice next to the farm and I ended up driving all the
way along a dirt track at the end of the valley before find somewhere
to turn round. There is a small layby by the stream and close to Tan y
Fridd farm where I managed to park.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was almost twelve o'clock by the time I
set off and the weather was far from promising. Cadair Berwyn was
covered in cloud and there was a cold wind blowing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I made my way past the telephone box and along the track through Maes
farmyard. I slogged up the slope along the edge of the wood to the
summit of Mynydd Tarw. I paused at the summit shelter by the corner of
the wood to take some photographs. There were good views over Cheshire
and Shropshire, but since there was a very cold wind blowing so I
didn't stop for long. Part way along the ridge towards Foel Wen it
started to sleet, so I stopped to put on my cagoule. The ridge was
clear of cloud, but even in mist the route finding would be easy -
just follow the line of the fence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I passed the sharp rock crest of Foel Wen South top and made my way
over to the flat main summit of Foel Wen. The path wasn't too wet and the
ground  hardly eroded by the passage of walkers. However, I imagine if
these mountains ever became a s popular as Snowdonia or the Peak
District the ridge would soon turn into a quagmire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I plodded on up to the summit of Tomle, which was marked by a small
white quartz cairn by the corner of the fence. The cloud over Cadair
Berwyn had begun to lift as I continued walking along the fence and
began the final pull up towards the summit ridge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cloud was just clear of the ridge as I walked along towards the
trig point. I couldn't pick out the Snowdonia mountains, but could see
the Arenings and Rhinogs. As I passed the new top, I saw a couple of
people sheltering in the huge windshelter. The cloud had begun to
descend again as I dropped down to the col between Cadair Berwyn and
Moel Sych. I followed the fence to the summit of Moel Sych, which is
just beyond a couple of styles. Unfortunately, the clag had really
descended and I couldn't see the view. I retraced my steps back to the
col and began descending the gully towards Llyn Lluncaws. There was a
small patch of snow at the top. Below I could see the two people from
the summit shelter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I followed the fence over to Moel yr Ewig and then on to the North
West top of Godor. There is a faint path, but it was very wet so I had
to take to the tussocky grass. There were a couple of peat groughs,
which reminded me of the Peak District. The going improved as I got
towards to summit of Godor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the top the way down isn't obvious. I walked down over the fields
through a series of open gates until I reached the track at the
bottom. It seemed a long way along the track back to the road, I would
have been better descending more to the west. However, it was only a
short way back down the hill to the car, where I changed my wet socks
and trousers while boling some water for a cup of hot chocolate.
