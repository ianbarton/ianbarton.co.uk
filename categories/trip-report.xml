On Wednesday MWIS was promising 70% chance of clear summits on the
Thursday and Friday. After months of rain, this looked like a chance
for an overnight trip over the Arans. However, on Thursday morning the
forecast was for only 10% chance of clear summits, but with a promise
of clouds clearing in the evening with Friday still forecast as 70%
clear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I decided on a late start from Llanuwchllyn on the Wednesday leaving
the small car park at the end of the village about 2:00pm. The weather
didn't look too promising. The summits of the Arenigs on the opposite
side of the valley were covered in cloud and it looked as though the
summits of the Arans were covered too. I set off up the long North
ridge of Aran Benllyn. After months of very wet weather, I was
expecting the ground to be completely sodden. However, it didn't seem
much worse than usual, which is still very wet! As I splashed upwards
through the bogs, I could see that the cloud was descending. I was
soon in the mist, although it wasn't actually raining.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="photofloatl"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a class="fancybox-thumb" rel="fancybox-thumb"  title="Summit of Aran Benllyn." href="/images/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2692.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img
 width="200" alt="Summit of Aran Benllyn." title="Summit of Aran Benllyn." src="/images/2012-07-Arans/thumb.DSCF2692.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
For some reason the North ridge always seems an awfully long way to
the summit (probably because it is). About 200m below the summit I met
a group of people descending and stopped for a short chat. Finally the
summit cairn of Aran Benllyn appeared out of the mist and I stopped
for a rest. I had hoped to continue over the summit of Aran Fawddwy
and continue round to the memorial cairn at Drws Bach camping near
Gwaun Lydan. As the weather showed no signs of improving I decided to
drop down from Erw y Ddafad-ddu to Creiglyn Dyfi. The only sensible
way down is via a steep grassy spur, which cuts through very steep
ground on the eastern face of the Arans. Finding the top of the spur
and picking the correct line of descent in the very limited visibility
could have proved very tricky. Anticipating this problem I
had loaded up a track from &lt;a href="http://v-g.me.uk/"&gt;v-g's&lt;/a&gt; web site into my Garmin GPS, which
lead me safely down into the cwm.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="photofloatr"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a class="fancybox-thumb" rel="fancybox-thumb"  title="Camp at Creiglyn Dyfi." href="/images/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2701.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img
 width="200" alt="Camp at Creiglyn Dyfi." title="Camp at Creiglyn Dyfi." src="/images/2012-07-Arans/thumb.DSCF2701.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The clag was well down and I only saw Creiglyn Dyfi when I was a
couple of hundred feet above it. Casting around for a decent spot to
camp, I settled on a very small level grassy area by the northern
shore. There was a small stream only a few yards away, which looked as
though it might flood my proposed site if there was a storm. However,
I decided to take the chance. As soon as I got the tent out it started
to rain. This was the first outing for my Terra Nova Voyager
Superlite. I had bought this tent in one of Field and Trek's 30%
discount, plus another 10% price matching from GoOutdoors. Although I
am very happy with my Zephyros 2, it isn't really suitable for two
people, whereas the Voyager has plenty of room. In fact it turns out
that the Voyager is slightly lighter than the Zephyros. However, it
does have one disadvantage. It's an inner pitch first and as I had
only put it up once indoors, so wasn't the fastest pitch. Just to make
life more difficult, there was only a very thin covering of grass over
the stones, so getting the pegs in was hard work. There were several
minutes of cursing before I finally got the tent up properly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course as soon as I had got the tent up it stopped raining. As I
was very wet, I decided to go for a bit of a wander round the lake
before retiring to the tent and getting into some dry
clothes. Creiglyn Dyfi is a very inspiring place to camp. The
edge was somewhat taken off the experience by the persistent clag
obscuring the views of the Arans. I crawled inside the tent, got into
some dry clothes and cooked tea. For one the Voyager is super spacious
and in the poor weather the large porch was great for cooking and
storing my wet clothes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="photofloatr"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a class="fancybox-thumb" rel="fancybox-thumb"  title="Cwm Cynlwydd." href="/images/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2720.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img
 width="200" alt="Cwm Cynlwydd." title="Cwm Cynlwydd." src="/images/2012-07-Arans/thumb.DSCF2720.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During the night there were several heavy showers, but luckily the
small stream next to me didn't burst its banks. Peering out of the
tent at 5:30am the next morning I could see that the cloud had risen
above the summit of Aran Fawddwy. I had planned on a quick descent
back to the car via Cwm Llwydd and Talardd. However, the prospect of
views from the summit ridge was enticing. I decided to retrace my
route and savour the views up there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="photofloatl"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a class="fancybox-thumb" rel="fancybox-thumb"  title="View SE from
Aran Benllyn." href="/images/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2722.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I packed away and began the long 1,000ft slog back up the grassy spur
to Erw y Ddafad-ddu. Inevitably as I climbed back up the steep slope,
the clag began to drop again. By the time I reached Erw y Ddafad-ddu
the whole ridge was covered. On the plus side, I could see a bright patch
where the sun was trying the break through and there was a steady
breeze. Sure enough by the time I had reached Aran Benllyn the clag
had mostly cleared the ridge, although Aran Fawddwy remained
covered. The air was exceptionally clear, so I got great views through
breaks in the mist. In some ways this was much better than unbroken
horizon to horizon views. Every few minutes a different patch of mist
would disperse and I would get a new view.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="photofloatr"&amp;gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Dropping down from the summit of Aran Benllyn, I emerged completely
from the clag. Somehow the descent of the north ridge seemed even
longer than the ascent. Eventually I arrived back to the car, where I
got into some dry clothes and made a brew before setting off back
. Although the weather was far from perfect it had been a very
satisfying trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
