I have never had a map case before. In fact I always thought of them
as a bit naff. However, after more than thirty years of stopping to
get the map out of the top pocket of my rucksack and then struggling
to fold it in the wind, I finally decided that it was time I bought a
map case.
</p>

<p>
I did some research on the various cases available and came to the
conclusion, that although it was expensive, the Ortlieb case was
probably the best option. I bought mine from <a href="http://www.facewest.co.uk/Ortlieb-Map-Case.html">Facewest</a>.
</p>

         alt="Ortlieb Map Case."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
When I unpacked the case I noticed how soft and flexible the material
felt. Several of the reviews I had read said how the case could easily
be rolled up, or even used as a seat, without creasing it. The roll
top closure system is very easy to use and has kept my maps dry. Now
that I have a map case, I wonder why I didn't buy one years ago. It's
not only useful for storing maps, but any other bits of paper that you might
want to refer to when walking, like bearings and distances. I have
also used it several times on cycle rides. On the bike if you sling it
over your shoulder it does tend to flap about a bit and get in the
way. However, it will attach to an Ortlieb bar bag. Oh no! Another bit
of kit to get.

I found this ride in "BikeFax - The best mountain bike trails in
Snowdonia". It's probably the easiest ride in the book, but well worth
doing. It's all on tracks or minor roads and is suitable for all but
very young children. You don't need a "Mountain Bike" for this route,
a road bike will be fine.

  &lt;p&gt;Llyn Padarn and the Glyders.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>
You could start the ride in several places. We have started from the
Caban at Brynrefail and from the lake at Llanberis. However,
the parking at Llanberis is Pay and Display, whereas the parking near
to the Caban is free.
</p>


<p>
From the Caban cycle over the bridge and turn left following the Lon
Las Peris route. You will have to lift your bikes over the first gate
on the old road. When the track meets the main road, pay close
attention to the signs. You need to go along the footpath a hundred
yards or so in the direction of Caernarfon and then cross the road,
where the track continues back in the direction of Llanberis. Soon
after crossing the road you pass through a short tunnel. You don't
need lights, but it can be quite dark so take care when cycling.

  &lt;p&gt;Initial steep hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
The path follows the shore of Llyn Padarn to emerge at the large car
park by the main road. Cross the road at the far end of the car park
and go past (or into) Pete's Eats. The route continues up Goodman
Street opposite to Pete's Eats. The steepest section of the ride is
just in front, but it's short lived. There is quite a lot more uphill,
but nothing really steep.

  &lt;p&gt;Slate Quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Make sure that you stop by the quarries and look through the fence
into their depths. As you continue to climb the views open
out. Snowdon and the Glyders behind and the coast and Anglesey in
front. The high point is Pen Y Bwlch and you now begine the steep
descent towards Bryn Bas Castle. Care is needed here because you may
meet cars coming uphill around the blind bends.

  &lt;p&gt;Bryn Bas Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
When you reach the castle you pass under an arch formed by the castle
walls and shortly after turn right. There is a short uphill section
before the final steep descent, via a couple of hairpins, into Cwm y
Glo. At the junction turn right and continue until you reach the
junction with the main road.

  &lt;p&gt;View West from Pen Y Bwlch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
Cross the road, turning right towards Llanberis. After a short
distance take the first turn left. This looks like the entrance to an
industrial estate at first glance. Tun right and follow a track which
emerges on the main road opposite to the bridge to Brynrefail. Cross
the main road and continue back to the Caban for well earned
refreshments.

I am a bit of a head torch addict. Over the years I have had a number
of different ones - mostly from Petzl. These include the original
Petzl Zoom, which used the old flat batteries and an updated version
which used AA batteries. These accompanied me on many Alpine and
Scottish winter trips. However, the battery life was limited, which
meant carrying heavy spares. In the case of the original Zoom the
connections could often be a bit dodgy, which meant disassembling the
torch in the dark in freezing cold to get it working again.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward 20 years or so and most head torches have LED
lights. They may not be quite as bright as the original torches, but
they run off AAA batteries, which means carrying spare batteries
doesn't have a significant weight penalty. Battery life is much
greater than the original Petzl Zoom and reliability seems
significantly better.
</p>

<p>
I already have a Petzl eLite, which lives in the car. Last year I
bought a Petzl ???. One reason for choosing this particular torch is
the red LED. This is useful outside when I don't want to
destroy my night vision. I also use the red LED at home, or on
holiday. I tend to get up much earlier than the rest of the family and
I can switch on the torch to see what I am doing without disturbing
anyone else.
</p>

<p>
However, it's usually in the wrong place. I use it at night when
I go outside to find the cats, or check on the buildings, but I also
keep it in the bedroom when I am asleep. Thus it's usually downstairs
when I want it upstairs or vice-versa. The obvious solution was to buy
yet another head torch, keeping one upstairs and one
downstairs. However, Petzl head torches are not cheap. Luckily I
discovered the Alpkit <a href="http://www.alpkit.com/shop/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=16345&amp;category_id=253">Gamma</a> . I have bought a few things from Alpkit
and been very happy with their products and service. The Gamma has
white, green and red LED's with a strobe mode for emergencies. There
is another red LED at the back of the battery box, which can also be
set to strobe. All this is an amazing £12.50 delivered, including
three Duracell AAA batteries.
</p>

<p>
I bought one just before Christmas and am delighted with it. I have
used the main beam when cycling, with the rear LED in flashing mode a
couple of times and at the speed I go there is plenty of illumination
on dark country lanes. It doesn't have the sliding filter over the
lens to switch between spot and flood modes that the Petzl has, but i
don't miss this. In fact I generally prefer it to my Petzl.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showell_Styles">Showell Styles</a> (known to his friends as "Pip") was a prolific author
with over 160 published books. I think that I first became aware of
his mountaineering writing when I used to read "Climber and Rambler",
where he published several articles. He also contributed to Ken
Wilson's "Classic Rock" writing about three climbs on the East Face of
Tryfan.

My father was an avid reader of seafaring books and one day I noticed
him reading a book by Showell Styles and that's how I found about his
fiction. Although I have my father's copies of many of his seafaring
fiction, I have never read any of his mountaineering books.
</p>

<p>
A few months ago I read a post on <a href="http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/forum/forummessages/mps/dt/1/UTN/38309/V/1/SP/">Outdoors Magic</a> which described
following one of Styles' routes described in his "Backpacking in
Wales" book the "Bay to Bay" walk. After reading the post I decided I
would also like to read "Backpacking in Wales". Although Styles books
have long been out of print, most of them are available from second
hand booksellers. A quick search showed up several copies, but for
some reason they were all priced between £20 and £35. This seemed a
little strange because almost all of Styles other books are available
for less than £10. Even stranger - if I visited the US sites of these
same booksellers the same book was available for $6! For a while I
considered trying to order the book via the US site. The books
themselves were all dispatched from Britain, but I decided that this
probably wouldn't work.
</p>

<p>
Today I was in Shrewsbury and went into a second hand book shop to see
if they had any mountaineering books. In the section with books about
Wales I found a copy of "Backpacking in Wales" in excellent condition
for £4.Unable to believe my good fortune, I promptly bought it.
</p>

<p>
There is a plate inside the book showing it originally belonged to DAG
Hampton Davies. The plate has a Welsh inscription "Duw Gwir a Gwiad".
The book itself is divided into three sections "Journeys for a
Fortnight", "Journeys for a Week" and "Journeys for a Weekend". Each
day of a walk is preceded by a detailed route description, followed by
Styles' own account of the day.  haven't read all the book yet, but it
has already given me several new ideas for walks and Styles'
descriptions of the Welsh landscape and his journeys through it are
always worth reading.
</p>

<p>
"Backpacking in Wales" by Showell Styles was published by Robert Hale (London)
in 1977.

In the warmer months of the year I wear my Paramo Cap. However,
in the recent very cold winter weather it wasn't really warm enough. I
have read many reviews of the Lowe Alpine Cap, which seems to be a
classic winter hat. The only drawback was the price of around £35. I
didn't want to spend that much on a hat I would probably only wear for
a limited period of the year. Luckily, I found it discounted to £15 in
a <a href="http://www.gooutdoors.co.ok">GoOutdoors</a> sale, so I ordered one.
</p>

<p>
Recently I succumbed to a  <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk">TGO</a> subscription offer, which included a
Trekmates Ice Cap. The rest of this post is a comparison of the
Paramo, Lowe Alpine and Trekmates caps.

I have been wearing it every day since early November and it has kept
my head warm and dry in all sorts of wet and cold conditions. The
outer is made from Goretex with fully taped seams and keeps out the
wort of the rain and snow. The inner is lined with warm fleecy
material and there is a small peak, which can be fastened out of the
way using a press stud.

The Trekmates Ice Cap is a very similar design to the Lowe. Hardly
surprising that they chose to copy such and excellent design. I got
mine as part of a <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk">TGO</a> subscription offer. The outer is Goretex Paclite
and the inner is a fleecy material similar to the Lowe.

I needed to buy a new watch and I wanted to get one that had altimeter
and compass functions in addition to the "normal" watch stuff. I did
quite a lot of research and it came down to a choice between the Casio
Protrek and a Suunto Core. There is a good comparison on Youtube
between the Suunto and a Casio Pathfinder <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLMO-9DCM8k">here</a> .
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Casio Protrek</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/casio_protrek.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Casio Protrek"><img src="galleries/casio_protrek.jpg"></a></b>


<p>
The Suunto has more functions, but costs considerably more (around
£170) than the Casio (around £90). The question was would I actually
use any of the additional functions in the Suunto? The main additional
functions in the Suunto are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Storm alarm if the barometric pressure drops suddenly.</li>

<li>Intelligent switching between barometer and altimeter modes.</li>

<li>Sunrise and sunset times.</li>

<li>More logging options for the altimeter and barometer.</li>

<li>User replaceable battery.</li>

<li>Countdown timer.</li>

<li>Magnetic declination setting on the compass.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of these the only options I would really miss are the user replaceable
battery and the countdown timer. I decided that for the difference in
price, I could live without these.
</p>

<p>
You may ask, "Why do you need a countdown timer?". I quite often want
to be reminded that I need to do something in 45 mins, or in two and a
half hours. I know that I could set an alarm to remind me. However,
using a countdown timer is much easier than doing the mental
arithmetic and fiddling with the clock to set the alarm for the
correct time.
</p>

<p>
So, I ended up ordering a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Casio-Sport-PRG-40-3VUR-Triple-Sensor/dp/B000HZUW5G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=watch&amp;qid=1283504787&amp;sr=1-1">Casio Protrek PRG-40-3VUR</a> from Amazon. When
it arrived I actually read the manual (there's a first time for
everything). However, after a bit of familiarising myself with
the various settings I found the watch very easy to use. I was
particularly keen to try out the altimeter. By default the watch tries
to work this out by itself, without requiring any reference
setting. Not surprisingly this turned out to be not particularly
accurate. However, once I set a reference altitude the altimeter was
accurate. Having an altimeter when hill walking, or climbing can be
very useful. In poor visibility it can make pin pointing your position
on a mountain much easier and it's a useful check on how much more you
need to climb before reaching the summit!
</p>

<p>
The compass seems accurate and will save me from having to keep
getting my Silva out of the rucksack. The alarm doesn't have a snooze
function and probably wouldn't be loud enough to wake me. However, I
always have my phone with me, which fulfils both these requirements.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks one of the small screws
securing the strap to the watch came out, thus the bar holding the
strap on could easily slide out. I took the watch to several jewellers
thinking that it would be a ten second job to put in a new
screw. However, it seems that whatever size screw Casio use isn't
generally available. I ended up returning the watch to Amazon for a
replacement. To Amazon's credit the whole process was painless. I
simply printed out a label for the courier to collect the old watch
and Amazon dispatched a new one to me immediately. I wish that other
on line retailers made this process as simple. I have only had the
replacement watch a couple of days, so here's hoping that I don't have
a problem with this one!

The girls have been pestering me for months to buy a hammock. By
accident I noticed that the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk">backpackinglight</a> web site had a
special promotion on lightweight <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/product29.asp?PageID=41">silk</a> hammocks. I ordered one and with
the usual efficient service it arrived next day.

<p>
Originally I was going to hang it using the frame from the swings, but
this turned out to be not quite long enough. Luckily the gate near the
back door has trees either side and the gap was just right for hanging
the hammock. For anyone else who wants to try this, the posts that you
hang the hammock from need to be about 12 feet apart.
</p>

<p>
It has been a great success, I have hardly been able to get the
children out of it since I put it up!

<p>
After weeks of poor weather the forecast was good for a couple of
days. The children were keen to go camping, so I suggested going to
the Cwmrhwyddfor Farm camp site near Tal y Llyn, off the A487
Dolgellau to Machynlleth road. I hadn't stayed there since the 1980's,
but remember it being a decent site.
</p>

<p>
We arrived late in the afternoon to be met at the entrance by the old
man who owns the farm. He now has very bad arthritis and spends his
day sitting in the car collecting camp site fees, while the rest of
the family work the farm. Although it was the middle of the summer
holidays, the site wasn't too crowded. We drove around the site and
settled near the far end of the top field next to a couple of large
family tents. These were occupied by a group of Scousers with several
small children and a number of dogs. We did wonder if they children or
the dogs would be noisy, but as it turned out they weren't the
problem.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Ella plodding up the scree slope.</b></p>

float-left" alt="Ella plodding up the scree slope."><img src="galleries/2010-08-cadair/DSCF0308.JPG"></a></b>



<p>
We went for tea at the pub at the end of Tal y Lyn, where the food was
basic "pub grub". We got back to the camp site as it was getting dark
and after half an hour or so chatting went to bed. The Scousers were
starting to enjoy themselves and as the evening progressed they got
drunker and louder. The noise continued until 12:30am when they
finally all passed out. Amazingly amidst all the racket the children
and dogs were silent, we reckon they must have drugged them.
</p>

<p>
We got up the next morning and after breakfast drove round to
Dolgellau to buy some socks for Hannah, as we had forgotten to bring
any! We drove round to the car park at Ty-nant. The plan was to walk
up to Llyn y Gadair, where I was going to take the children up Cyfrwy
Arete. I knew that the Pony Path that starts from near the car park
lead up the ridge to the summit and didn't provide easy access to the
Cwm. We crossed the road and walked through the camp site and through
the trees on the far side of Llyn Gwernan. The plan was to try and cut
across either end of the lake to join the path starting from the
Gwernan Lake Hotel. Unfortunately, this didn't work out as planned and
we had to go a long way past the end of the lake before regaining the
road and back tracking to the hotel. To add insult the injury it was a
Monday and guess which is the only day of the week the hotel is
closed? Rather than a nice bar meal, we sat on the benches outside and
munched our sandwiches.
</p>

<p>
The walk up to the Cwm containing Llyn y Gadair was really
enjoyable. The views of Cadair gradually unfold as you gain
height. Even the fact that I was carrying a heavy sack with four sets
of climbing gear didn't spoil it. I had told everyone that we would be
walking up to a lake, but neglected to mention that there were two
lakes. There was an outbreak of moaning when we arrived at Llyn Gafr
and I said that we had to continue up the steep slope in front to Llyn
y Gadair. It was about 2:00pm by the time we arrived and I estimated
it would take about 2hrs to climb the arete itself, plus however long
it took us to get to the bottom of it. So reluctantly we decided that
there wasn't time to do the climb.
</p>

<p>
Having got this far, I wanted to traverse the summit. Ella said that
she wanted to come with me, but the others decided to descend. I gave
them the map and showed them that they just needed to contour along
the slope until they joined the Foxes path, which would lead them back
to the car.
</p>

<p>
Ella and I walked over towards the start of the 1,000 foot scree
slope that leads to the summit of Penygadair. I checked the altitude
on my Casio Protrek watch and was pleased to see that it agreed with
the map. The scree slope is very badly eroded and the only thin worse
than ascending it would be descending it. With my big load I was going
slowly. Ella was tired and kept stopping for rests. However, she never
once complained, even though she had a blister. As we gained height
we were exposed to the wind. We stopped to put on our Rab Generator
smocks, which have been a great gear success.
</p>

<p>
On the summit ridge the wind was buffeting Ella and by the cairn she
could lean into the wind with her whole body weight. It seemed a long
way along the Pony Track before it began dropping back into the
valley. Just before we started descending,we met two mountain bikers
who had cycled up from Dolgellau and were carrying their bikes. I
started to get cramp in my legs, but drinking some water soon relieved
the symptoms.
</p>

<p>
The forecast had been for the weather to deteriorate in the evening
and I could see clouds arriving from the direction of Barmouth and
beginning to envelop the higher ground. Luckily, we managed to get
back to the road before it started raining. At the junction with the
road I didn't know whether to turn left or right, as I had given the
map to the others. I decided to turn right and in less than five
minutes we were back at the car.
</p>

<p>
We drove back to Dolgellau and had tea at Y Sospan in Queens
Square. This is a great little cafe/restaurant in the old (1606)
jailhouse. We had a cup of coffee and a snack there earlier in the
day. The food in he evening was very good and reasonably priced. They
are also very child friendly.

The Manifold Valley in Derbyshire has an 8.5 mile cycle trail that
follows the line of an old railway line through the valley. It's a
linear ride, so you will end up cycling the trail both ways, but it's
so enjoyable that this isn't a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
There is a short section along a quiet lane and the ride is almost
completely flat, so it's suitable for children. you can begin either
at Hulme End or Waterhouses and there is ample car parking at either
end. My personal preference is to start at Hulme End because the ride
to Waterhouses is very slightly uphill, so it's downhill almost all
the way back!
</p>

<p>
There is a cafe at Hulme End, which is closed on Mondays, one
at Wetton Mill and another one at a farm about a mile from the
Waterhouses end of the trail.
</p>

<p>
The trail passes close to <a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=142">Beeston Tor</a> which has some classic rocks
climbs. There is also Thor's Cave up on the hillside. You can park the
bikes at the bottom and follow an obvious path that climbs up to the
cave, where you get an excellent view over the Manifold Valley. The
cave was probably occupied by humans as long as 10,000 years
ago. Stone tools and the remains of long extinct animals have been
found inside the cave.
</p>

<p>
The trail is very popular with walkers and cyclists. However, if you
get up early you can have it almost completely to yourself.

very clean and the owners (Mr &amp; Mrs Goodwin) very friendly. The site
is a single field, which both times we have stayed there has been very
quiet. The village shop and the pub in Hulme End are about a mile
away. One of the best features of the site from our point of view is
that's really in the middle of nowhere.

<a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-erddig">Erddig</a> is owned by the National Trust, to whom it was bequeathed by
the last Squire, Philip Yorke. The Yorke family maintained a
fascinating collection of portraits and photographs of people who
worked on the estate. Outside there is a formal garden and landscaped
park.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to do a short ride completely within the
grounds. However, the ride can easily be extended along the quiet
country lanes surrounding Erddig. You can hire cycles, including
tandems, for very reasonable rates. The last time we went we hired a
tandem for two of our children, which they really enjoyed riding. The
cycle hire shop is within the property itself, so if you are not a
National Trust member, you will have to pay to access the
shop. However, you could also take the opportunity to look round the
house and formal gardens. The park land surrounding the formal gardens
is freely accessible, so if you bring your own bikes you can do the
rides without paying to enter the house.
</p>

<p>
The hire shop has a leaflet which shows a couple of rides of about 3
miles through the grounds and along the local lanes. We did both these
one after the other on a sunny day.
