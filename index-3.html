<a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-erddig">Erddig</a> is owned by the National Trust, to whom it was bequeathed by
the last Squire, Philip Yorke. The Yorke family maintained a
fascinating collection of portraits and photographs of people who
worked on the estate. Outside there is a formal garden and landscaped
park.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to do a short ride completely within the
grounds. However, the ride can easily be extended along the quiet
country lanes surrounding Erddig. You can hire cycles, including
tandems, for very reasonable rates. The last time we went we hired a
tandem for two of our children, which they really enjoyed riding. The
cycle hire shop is within the property itself, so if you are not a
National Trust member, you will have to pay to access the
shop. However, you could also take the opportunity to look round the
house and formal gardens. The park land surrounding the formal gardens
is freely accessible, so if you bring your own bikes you can do the
rides without paying to enter the house.
</p>

<p>
The hire shop has a leaflet which shows a couple of rides of about 3
miles through the grounds and along the local lanes. We did both these
one after the other on a sunny day.

Llyn Brenig is a man made reservoir situated in a large area of
moorland between Denbigh and the A5. There a many possible rides in
this area. The one described is a circuit of the lake and is
approximately 10 miles long. There is a short section along a B road,
but this isn't normally busy. The ride is described going round the
lake in an anticlockwise direction, as route finding is easier this
way.
</p>

<p>
From the Visitor Centre find the track that runs in a southerly
direction along the side the reservoir. It starts opposite the cycle
hire place. Cycle over the dam and follow the stone track along the
reservoir. This leads through a short section of forest and finally
onto a small lane. Follow the lane to the junction with the B4510 ad
turn left onto the road.
</p>

<p>
This is where the uphill section starts! It isn't too steep but is
fairly continuous. Eventually you reach the summit, where the map
shows a parking place with picnic table. In April 2010 the table
wasn't there, but the parking place is a good place to admire the view
and recover from the climb.
</p>

<p>
There is now a nice downhill section, which leads to a T
junction. Turn left and take the second forestry track on the left
(the first one leads to a dead end). This descends down to the
reservoir, where you can follow the shore back to the Visitor
Centre. Be careful not to take any turns leading off to the right as
these will lead you back to the B4501.
</p>

<p>
You can download a PDF showing the route taken by this ride from <a href="http://www.hiraethog.org.uk/download.php?id=288.2&amp;lID=1">here</a>
. There are details of other cycle rides on the <a href="http://www.ridehiraethog.com/ridehiraethog/the_routes2.asp">ridehiraethog</a> web

The Visitor Centre is open seven days a week between March and the end
of October. There is a good cafe and an and outside play area for the
children. They can be contacted on 01490 420463 or you can view their

Normally I go walking either in my trainers, or in a cheap and
comfortable pair of hi-Tec boots. However, this summer we had decided
to visit the Dolomites and I wanted something that I could use on the
Via Ferrata's. Whilst my Hi-Tec boots have been really comfortable for
walking, the soles are very bendy and not suitable for climbing.
</p>

<p>
I wandered into Cotswold's Chester store with the intention of buying
a pair of Asolo Flame GTX boots. However, after trying a few pairs on
I found that they were a bit narrow for my broad feet. Previous
experience has taught me that if a boot feels a bit uncomfortable to
start with, it will probably feel uncomfortable for ever.
</p>

<p>
The assistant suggested that I try on a pair of Meindl boots as they
were a broader fit. He disappeared into the stock room and re-appeared
with several boxes. I tried on a pair of Meindl Softline Ultras, which
immediately felt comfortable. I tried on a few different sizes to make
sure that I had got the best fit and wandered about the shop in them.
</p>

<p>
I bought them and wore them at home for about an hour before the
holiday. I also wore them on the plane to Italy, but their first real
test was a six hour walk around Sassalungo. This is definitely not the
recommended method of breaking in new boots. However, I felt
comfortable all the way round and at the end of the day my feet had no
blisters or sore spots. I just hope that they last a long time, so I
don't have to worry about buying another pair of boots for some time!

This summer we went on a family holiday to Val Gardena, in the Italian
Dolomites. This was our first visit to the Dolomites I was keen to
climb a Via Ferrata. Two of of the children wanted to come with me, so
I wanted to choose a route that was hard enough to be interesting,
easily accessible and not too long.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Cir V. Aproximate line of route marked</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/dolomites/DSCF0191.JPG" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Cir V. Aproximate line of route marked"><img src="galleries/dolomites/DSCF0191.JPG"></a></b>


<p>
We were staying in Selva and after extensive research (OK, so I
noticed the route from the cable car station), we decided on the Cir
V. The start of the route was only about half an hour's walk from the
Dantercepies telepherique. According to the Cicerone Guide the route
was grade 2 and the descent was straightforward. You can see more
photographs of the route <a href="posts/2010-07-21-dolomites-photos/index.html">here</a>
</p>


<p>
I had brought a rope, harnesses and a minimal climbing rack, but we
had no Via Ferrata gear. A trip round the gear shops in Selva soon had
us kitted out. On the morning of the climb John was too tired to come
with us, so Ella and I set off on our own. To get to the foot of the
climb involves a short walk from the telepherique station, followed by
a plod up the gully. At the top of the gully a short iron ladder marks
the start of the route.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Ella on Cir V Via Ferrata</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/dolomites/DSCF0211.JPG" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Ella on Cir V Via Ferrata"><img src="galleries/dolomites/DSCF0211.JPG"></a></b>


<p>
I wasn't sure what to expect, so had brought along a 50 metre
rope. However, we didn't need to use it and it stayed in the bottom of
the sack for the whole route. From the top of the ladder I stepped
right onto the face and climbed up this to a good ledge at the foot of
a steep wall. Ella soon joined me, managing both the climbing and the
clipping into the wire with ease.
</p>

<p>
There were a couple of Germans behind us and I offered to let them
climb past us. Once the two Germans had climbed past us, we started up
the steep wall above. The anchor points on the wall were well placed,
set closer together on sections that were more difficult. Above the
steep wall there was a leftwards traverse into a chimney. This lead
upwards to the shoulder below the final summit bock. There was a short
walk/scramble along the ridge to reach the summit block. A short steep
climb lead up the small summit, where I clipped Ella onto the cross,
as there were large drops all around us. The two Germans, who had
arrived at the summit a few minutes before us, greeted us with a "Berg
Heil" and a handshake. They both congratulated Ella on how well she
had climbed the route.
</p>

<p>
We stayed on the summit for about 20 minutes admiring the views and
taking photos.
</p>

<p>
Down climbing from the summit block, we descended into a gully. The
top part of the descent was protected by a cable, although it wasn't
really difficult. However, there were a lot of loose blocks and I
wouldn't have liked to have been descending with a lot of other people
above me. About forty minutes later we were back at the telepherique
station, where the others had come up to meet us.
</p>

<p>
We had both enjoyed the route so much, that we came back the next
morning with John and did it again. This time we made a very early start,
arriving at the base of the route before the first chair lift from
Corvara had arrived, so we had the whole route to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
I really enjoyed the climbing and it's a good route for children,
since it's short and wouldn't be too difficult to retreat from in the
event of bad weather. My only reservation would be the danger of stone
fall on the descent if the route was really crowded.

This was the day of the England versus West Germany World Cup match,
so it seemed like a good idea to go for a walk. I couldn't persuade
anyone else to come out with me so decided the visit Cwm Cywarch,
where I have never been before. I also wanted to climb Aran Fawddwy,
which would be another first for me.

<p>
I managed to find the road into Cwn Cywarch easily enough. The turn
off from Abercywarch onto the minor road into the cwm is actually sign
posted. The final section of road is single track, but luckily I only
met one car coming the opposite way and I was close to a passing
place. There is a small car park next to the farm at Blaencywarch
Farm. This was almost empty and I parked next to a car whose occupants
were going climbing on Craig Cywarch. It was predicted to be the
hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching 30C. Not
wanting to repeat my experience of getting dehydrated on the Glyders,
I made sure that I packed plenty of fluids.
</p>

<p>
I put on my boots and set off up the road past the farm. The path is
well marked on the left just past the farm and climbs up the hillside
past an obvious tree. It continues up alongside a stream up the
obvious gully to the col below Glasgwm. There are good views
northwards over the Rhinogs from here.
</p>

<p>
The path now follows the line of a fence, which runs slightly East of
North. This area can be very wet and boggy and there are several
sections with duckboards. Luckily, after the recent extended dry spell
it was almost completely dry and I didn't need the duckboards.
</p>

<p>
You can see the summit of Aran Fawddwy in the distance. In poor
visibility the fence would be a very useful navigational aid. As you
approach the summit area, the ground steepens slightly and about half
a kilometre from the top a fence comes in from the right. The descent
route follows this fence. Note that you cross a couple of other fence
before you reach this one.
</p>

<p>

float-left" alt="View of the Rhinogs"><img src="galleries/2010-06-arans/DSCF2193.JPG"></a></b>



<p>
Finally you emerge on the summit plateau and the trig point is visible
some way in front. The view from the summit is exceptional. Looking
North along the ridge over Aran Benllyn, Lake Bala is visible. To the
South Cadair Idris stands out and there are views over most of the
other peaks of North and mid Wales. Below the steep East face the
isolated waters of Creiglyn Dyfi can be seen. To the North East vast
areas of boggy moorland surrounding Lake Vyrnwy are visible.
</p>

<p>
While I was on the summit the wind had picked up, so I put on my
Paramo Tores Gilet. I retraced my steps back to the junction of the
two fences and set off towards the cairn on the ridge above the valley
of Hengwm. This commemorates Mike Aspain, a member of the RAF mountain
rescue team, who was killed in 1960 by lightning near here. From here
the path continues to the summit of Drysgol. There are fine
retrospective views of Aran Fawddwy from the whole of this
section. The wind had blown in the clouds from the west and the
summit of Aran Fawddwy was intermittently disappearing.
</p>


<p>

float-left" alt="Looking towards the memorial cairn"><img src="galleries/2010-06-arans/DSCF2215.JPG"></a></b>


<p>
Once over the summit of Drysgol, I headed downhill towards the col at
the base of Waun Goch. From the col there is an obvious path that
heads South West along the western slope of Waun Goch, leading back to
the road a hundred yards or so from the car park. As I descended the
track the cloud over the summits began to disperse again and they were
clear by the time I got back to the road.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the two climbers, I saw only two other people, one near the
summit of Aran Fawddwy and one near the bottom of the final descent. I
was surprised at the remoteness of Aran Fawddwy. In the good
conditions I experienced it was straightforward, but in poor
visibility navigating the route would be quite a challange. Although
there are paths their relativley uneroded state, given the boggy
nature of the ground, suggests that there must be relatively light
traffic. I shall definitely be back, possibly on a two day trip, to
explore the area better.

For many years I owned a Karrimor Hot Ice rucksack. Generally, I was
very happy with it. However, it did have two slight failings: firstly
it was slightly too small and secondly for something called "Hot Ice"
it had absolutely rubbish axe attachments. Like all the original sacks
made in Accrington it lasted for years.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago I bought a replacement Karrimor, wich was a tear drop
design, with zip closure. I can't remember exactly how much it cost,
but it was quite cheap. The materials and construction weren't up to
the old Karrimor standard, but given the price, I didn't expect them
to be. Recently, the stitching around the zip started to give way and
the whole lot began to fray.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to replace it with something that was large enough to use as
a climbing day sack, but could also be used for cycling, or just going
for a day walk. I decided that what I wanted was a sack that was
around 30 litres, single compartment and not a pear drop shape with
zip fastening. There are probably hundreds of sacks that meet this
specification, so it took quite a bit of research. I was happy to pay
for something that would last, but if it was going to be expensive, I
wanted to make sure I liked it!
</p>

<p>
Finally, I settled on an Osprey Talon 33. One of the things I liked
was that it came in a range of back sizes. I am 6ft 2", so generally
need a long back size. However, I had read a review on the <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/gear/packs/day-packs/osprey-talon-33-70-1.988102">TGO</a> web
site, which although quite positive stated that it was let down by the
back being too flexible. I went along to my local branch of Cotswold,
who had it in a sale, to try one out. I think that Osprey must have
changed the design since TGO's review, since the back on the sack I
tried on wasn't at all floppy.
</p>

<p>
The pack itself is very light (0.92kg according to the data sheet) and
although the shoulder straps aren't padded, they seem comfortable
enough when carrying a load. The shoulder straps have a couple of
small pouches on them, which are apparently for holding energy gels. I
can't see me using these, but then they don't weigh much! The back
length is adjustable using a velcro attachment system. Easy to adjust,
but you will probably only ever use it once. There isn't an internal
frame, but there does seem to be some sort of semi rigid back panel,
which gives the back some stability. The back panel itself is covered
in some sort of mesh, which aids ventilation.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of tension straps, which make it easy to fold the
sack down to carry small loads. There are several small features which
make the pack more attractive:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Zipped pockets in the hip belt, large enough to hold something like
a compact camera.</li>

<li>An external bladder pocket. Not much use to me, but nice if you use
a bladder.</li>

<li>Internal zipped mesh pocket in the lid.</li>

<li>External zipped lid pocket, which also contains a velcroed pouch,
for things like keys.</li>

<li>Captive ends for the adjustable straps to stop them blowing in your face.</li>

<li>Nifty web strap under the lid to hold your rope.</li>

<li>Stretch front and side pockets.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have used the sack a few times now and am very happy with it. It
costs around £80.

I wanted to get some trousers which were cool enough for cycling and
walking in hot summer weather. I get too hot in my Craghopper Kiwis
when cycling in warm weather. Also I have to tuck the ends into my
socks to stop them getting tangled up in the chain, as I don't like
cycle clips.
</p>

<p>
The last time I was in Betwys y Coed I saw a pair of Montane Terra
Pants in Cotswold. I had read many good reviews of these pants, but as
they are expensive I didn't want to buy a pair without seeing them and
trying some on. Having tried them on and decided that I like them, I
wanted to buy a pair. I wanted a black pair, but Cotswold didn't have
any in stock. I searched on line and ended up buying them from <a href="http://www.towerridge.co.uk">Tower
Ridge</a>. I bought my Rab sleeping back from them and they have been
quick and efficient. The trousers were posted the same day as my order
and arrived the next day.
</p>

<p>
I got a chance to try them out straight away during the current hot
spell. I have used them for cycling and as everyday wear for a
couple of weeks. Overall I am very happy with them:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lightweight and very comfortable. Not too hot in summer, but I shall
be interested to see how they fare in the other seasons.</li>
<li>Zipped pockets, make it harder to lose your keys or money.</li>
<li>Zipped thigh vents, with black mesh underneath, so people can't see
my pasty white legs.</li>
<li>Zipped bottoms making them easy to roll up, or fit over big boots.</li>
<li>Poppers on the bottom of the legs. You can use these to cinch
up the ankles, so they don't get snagged in bike chains, or let cold
drafts in. You can also roll the legs up and use the poppers to stop
them unfolding.</li>
<li>Reinforced knee and bum patches.</li>
<li>Enough room around the crotch and articulated knees, so good for
scrambling and climbing.</li>
<li>Smart enough for everyday use.</li>

but anything more than a brief shower will wet them. However, they
do dry quickly.</li>

<p>
In fact I like them so much, that  have just ordered a second pair.

When I was a small child, in the 1960's, we often stayed at Cobdens in
Capel Curig. The hotel was then owned by a Mrs Newman, who also owned
the Tyn y Coed just down the road. I think that she also owned the
hotel on the A5 at Pentrefoelas. She lived in the house opposite to
Cobdens, by the green bridge over the river. Cobdens was always a bit
ramshackle, but in a nice sort of way.
</p>

<p>
In the 1970's Cobdens had really gone down hill and my parents started
to stay up the road at the <a href="http://www.bryntyrchinn.co.uk/">Bryn Tyrch</a> . By this time I had left home,
so didn't stay there with them, but often called to have a meal with
them when my weekend trips to North Wales coincided with theirs. Over
the years I have drunk countless pints of beer and eaten innumerable
bar meals at the Bryn Tyrch. Recently the hotel has been refurbished and
the standard and choice of food has been greatly improved. There are
still the old photographs, taken by the guidebook author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._A._Poucher">WA Poucher</a>,
who use to stay here.
</p>

<p>
We have three children and now that they are getting older, we tend
not to stay in hotels and guest houses, as we can no longer all fit in
one room, so it can work out very expensive. However, it turns out the
Bryn Tyrch has a couple of bunk rooms inside the hotel, which meant
that we could fit in one room and the children had a room to
themselves. The food was excellent, importantly there were things that
the children would eat available in child size portions.
</p>

<p>
The standard of the rooms was very good, with excellent
breakfasts. The staff are also family friendly and the price for B&amp;B
for all five of us very reasonable. The location of the hotel in Capel
Curig is ideal for visiting all parts of Snowdonia. In fact you can
start many walks from the hotel itself, so you don't have to drive at
all. I am sure that we shall be staying there again.
