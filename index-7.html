Another short trip, starting late in the day to avoid the heat. I had
done the same trip last year and enjoyed it so much, I decided to do
it again! The original inspiration for this trip came from <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/T0607/T0607.htm">v-g</a>
excellent site.

<p>
Last time I had parked in the small pull in near to the start of the
track leading up to Llyn Arenig Fawr. However, this left me with quite
a bit of road walking on the second day. So I decided to park in the
large area opposite the quarry at 830393, which meant I would get most
of the road walking done at the start of the first day.
</p>

<p>
I left the car around 4:00pm and made my way to the start of the
track. It is possible to follow the old railway track alongside the
road, but you need to cut back to the road at one point and it seemed
simpler to just walk along the road. The temperature was gradually
cooling, but it was still very hot at around 25C. As I made my way up
the track towards Llyn Arenig Fawr I met a couple of people
descending. There was a group with a couple of tents just setting up,
below the dam wall. I had a quick look in the bothy, as I had read
that it had been vandalized recently. However, it seemed to have been
repaired as it looked in good condition.
</p>

<p>
The cotton grass was out, making the large areas of grass look much
more attractive. I also noticed what I know as "Cuckoo spit" - frothy
white liquid attached to the blades of grass.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
I filled my water bottle from the reservoir and began the plod up the
slope leading to Arenig Fawr. Last time I had followed the path that
contours all the way along the East face before finally gaining the
ridge just below the summit of Arenig Fawr. This time I wanted to gain
the ridge earlier by climbing directly up the grass slope on the
right. This would give me god views both to the East and West as I
climbed towards the summit. On my first attempt I left the path too
early and ended up regaining it a bit higher up. However, I could now
see the ridge line and on my second attempt got up onto the ridge. The
heat had made the distant views hazy, but there was still a fine
prospect of almost every peak in Snowdonia.

&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Reaching the summit of Arenig Fawr, I sat down next to the memorial to
the crew of the B17 Flying Fortress, which had crashed on the
slopes. There were several small wooden crosses and poppies beneath
the memorial, presumably placed there on Remembrance Day. I am not
really a fan of memorials on mountains, but there are certain historic
ones that have been there for many years. It was good that somebody
had gone to the trouble of placing the poppies beneath the plaque. I
wondered if any of the airmen's families had ever visited this spot.

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
It was now 6:00pm and I wanted to get to Moel Llyfnant before
sunset. I set off down the South ridge towards the area of small lakes
and grassy knolls. I needed to stock up on water. However, I expected
the small stream on the western slope leading down to the col would be
dry. I scooped some water out of one of the lakes into a Platypus and
it had a distinct green tinge. There were no obvious sources of
running water and I knew there were none on Moel Llyfnant. Luckily I
had brought my <a href="http://www.drinksafe-systems.co.uk/products.php">Travel Tap</a>. I don't normally bother
purifying water in the UK, as there are usually ample supplies of
clean water. However, I had anticipated a problem because of the
recent dry weather and so had brought
my Travel Tap along with me. I filled up all three one litre Platypus
bottles from the lake before walking over to the corner of the fence that marks the
start of the descent to the col below Moel Llyfnant.
</p>

<p>
As I expected all the little streams were dry, as was the normally boggy
section at the col. The ascent to Moel Llyfnant is steep and
unremitting, but not too far. I sweated my way up the steep grass
taking a direct line towards the summit, popping out on the ridge only
a few yards away from the cairn.
</p>

<p>
I camped on a small sheltered area close to the summit. There was just
enough of a breeze to keep the insects away. After taking on board
lots of fluid and a Hot Cereal Start, I sat by the summit cairn and
watched the sun setting over Snowdon.
</p>

<p>
It was a very warm night and I slept with the doors open. Sometime
after it went dark, I emerged from the tent to look at the stars. Even
in the middle of the night I was quite comfortable in just shirt
sleeves. I woke again shortly after 4:00pm. It was already getting
light and climbing out of the tent I could see the sky glowing red
behind Arenig Fawr. I got out the camera and took photos as the sun
climbed over the shoulder of Arenig Fawr.

<p>
I had packed up by 7:00am and began descending the North Ridge towards
the abanodoned cottage of Amnod-bwll. Last time I had retraced my
ascent route back to the col and had bushwacked through long tussocky
wet bog to the edge of the plantation, which was really
unpleasant. The North ridge was much nicer, with short grass and no
boggy bits. There are traces of a path, intermingled with lots of
misleading sheep tracks. However, if you just head on a bearing
towards Amnodd-bwll you will emerge onto a farm track near to the
bottom of the hill.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
From Amnodd-bwll I followed the forestry road. There comes a point near
to the ruined buildings of Amnodd-wen where the track divides. I couldn't
remember which branch I should take and set off down the left hand
one. After a few hundred yards I could see that this was the wrong way
and would bring me out much too far up the road, so I back
tracked. The right hand branch of the path soon leads to a very boggy
section next to a wall. Whichever way you choose is wet, even in the
current drought conditions. After a short distance I reached a style
beyond which the splash fest became a farm track. I descended past the
farm and onto a recently made track above the railway line. This
emerged onto the road only about a kilometre from the car.

My son was doing his D of E Bronze expedition over the weekend,
starting from Llandegla. The weather forecast was for hot and sunny
conditions over the next few days. I didn't want to waste the
opportunity for an overnight trip, but has to be back home at midday
on the Saturday morning. However, we wouldn't be
arriving at Llandegla until about 7:00pm, which left very limited
time for me to drive into Snowdonia and get up to a summit.

<p>
Sunset at this time of year was 9:37pm. The closest mountains,
the Arans, only about 30mins drive away. I had completed an
Arans circuit a couple of weeks ago and didn't want to go back so
soon. Finally, I decided on the Mooelwyns, which were about an hour
and fifteen minutes drive from Llandegla. I would be completing about
half the walk after sunset, but navigation was simple, just follow
the ridge and at this time of year it never goes properly dark.

I arrived at the car park in Tanygrisiau shortly before 8:30pm. I had
packed my rucksack before leaving home, so all I needed to do was get
out of the car and start walking. My plan was to walk up the reservoir
road to Llyn Stwlan, climb Moelwyn Bach, descend back to the col and
then climb Moelwyn Mawr where I would camp on the summit. I had done
this trip in <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/posts/2012/Apr/13/a-trip-over-the-moelwyns/">April</a> last year, when I experienced a hail storm on my
ascent of Moelwyn Bach and the summit was misted out.
</p>

<p>
Wandering up the reservoir road munching a cheese and onion sandwich,
I met two groups of two people descending. I soon reached the dam
wall and crossed the stream below it. I couldn't remember if it was
easy to access Llyn Stwlan from this side, so I collected water from
the outfall pipe below the dam. Once I had climbed the concrete steps
at the far side of the dam, I would see that I could easily have
collected my water from the lake, something to remember for next time.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
The route from Llyn Stwlan follows a fairly direct line over semi
boggy ground to the col between Moelwyn Mawr and Moelwyn Bach. I
reached the col at around 9:25pm in time to see the sun setting. I
dumped my sack and managed to get to the summit of Moelwyn Bach before
the sun disappeared completely. I sat on the summit cairn and watched
it disappear over the summit of the Nantlle Ridge and Molewyn
Mawr.After taking some photos I retraced my steps to the col. I had
left my sack in plain view near to the path. There wasn't anyone else
about at this time and I didn't want to lose sight of it in the
gathering gloom.

The ascent of Craigysgafn involves a pleasant scramble. Much better
than my <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/posts/2012/Apr/13/a-trip-over-the-moelwyns/">last</a> visit when this section was more like a winter climb,
with the rocks covered in verglas and hail. The ascent to Moelwyn
Mawr was much longer than I remembered and it was 11:00pm when I
arrived at the summit cairn. Even though the sun had disappeared
nearly two hours before, it was still light enough to see without a
head torch.

</p>

<p>
I set up the tent on a patch of grass close to the summit cairn. As I
had been climbing towards the summit I had noticed the valleys below
me starting to fill with cloud. I made a hot drink and some porridge
and it was nearly midnight when I go into my sleeping bag. At around
4:00am an attack of cramp had me hopping about outside the tent. The
sun was due to rise shortly after 4:30am, but already there was a red
tinge in the Eastern sky. All the surrounding valleys were full of
mist, with the odd sliver blowing over the summit. Only the tops of
the mountains were visible.
</p>

<p>
I crawled back into the tent and watched the sun rising through the
door. As the sun started to come up, the fragments of mist on the
summit dispersed and I was treated to the best inversion I have seen
in Wales. I sat outside the tent for a couple of hours watching as
the heat of the rising sun made caused the mist in below to swirl and
change shape.

</p>

</div>

<p>
I packed up around 7:00am and began to make my way downwards and over
to Moel-yr-hydd. By the time I had reached the summit the heat of the
sun had caused the mist to rise although, Moel-yr-hydd was still
clear. I descended into the mist towards the old quarry
workings. Eventually some old buildings appeared out of the mist and
I followed a path. However, this ended on top of a steep slope of
slate scree. Not wishing to scramble down, I back-tracked to the
buildings and found the track that leads down through the various
levels. I soon dropped below the mist and enjoyed a pleasant walk
through Cwmorthin back to the road. I drove the short distance to the
lakeside cafe for a second breakfast.

<p>
Finally a period of sunny weather. I had wanted to get out for an
overnight trip, but the weather had put paid to any trips so far this
year. After dropping the children off at the school bus I set off for
North Wales. I still hadn't decided exactly where I was going, but on
my way over the A5104 made up my mind to have a go at the Arans
traverse and camp on Glasgwm. This was a trip that I had been thinking
about for some time, as I had never climbed Glasgwm. After several
trips over the Arans in indifferent weather, I had wanted to save the
circuit for a settled period of fine weather.

<p>
The plan was to park in Cwm Cowarch, then walk up Hengwm and over the
summit of Aran Fawddwy followed by a crossing of the boggy along the
boardwalks and then a final pull up Glasgwm, where I would camp next
to Llyn y Fign. The next morning I would follow my route of ascent
back to the path leading down into Cwm Cwyarch and so back to the car park.

<p>
I packed my rucksack and emptied a bottle of flavoured water into one
of my Platypus bottles. I set off from the car park shortly after
11:00am heading for Hengwm. Just after I had crossed the stream a few
hundred yards from the car park, I realized that I had left the
Platypus with the flavoured water in the car. Rather than go back for
it, I filled another Platypus up from the river. This wasn't really
enough water for the whole day, but I thought I would be
able to get more water higher up.

<p>
Walking up Hengwm I was in the shade, which made for pleasant walking
as it was very hot in the sun. On the far side of the valley I had a
perfect view of Craig Cwyarch, with its great rock climbs like "Will
o' the Wisp" and Acheron. Cresting the slope up to the col, I decided
against plodding through the peat hags to visit the top of Waun Goch
and struck out up the slope towards Drysgol. When I reached the
memorial at Drws Bach I stopped for a drink and ate the slice of
Victoria sponge I had brought with me. The summit ridge of Aran
Fawddwy was completely clear and there were great views over the
steep East face and down to Craiglyn Dyfi, where I had pitched the
Voyager Superlite last year for the first time in pouring rain.

<p>
After a short rest, I continued up towards the summit of Aran
Fawddwy. On the way I crossed a ladder style and noticed a small
plaque with the OS grid reference on it. On the rest of the walk I saw
that every style now had one of these plaques. I can't help thinking
that putting these everywhere is destroying the remoteness that many
people seek in the mountains.  There was someone resting near to the
cairn who said that he was reccing a walk he was planning to lead at
the wearing the weekend. After he left I got out my lunch and ate it
with my feet dangling over the drop above Craiglyn Dyfi. I thought
that there would be pools of water around the summit, but I could find
any. I new that there were several big pools near to the summit of
Aran Benllyn. However, I was too lazy to walk the extra distance to
Aran Benllyn and thought I would be certain to find more water before
my ascent of Glasgwm. This turned out to be a bad decision!

<p>
When I had finished lunch I started to make my way back down the
summit pyramid to join the fence that would take me to the bottom of
Glasgwm. I could see the cairn on the summit clearly, but knew that
it was a fair distance to walk before I reached the final slopes up
to its summit. Just after I crossed the ladder style at the start of
the fence, I met another man who was sitting admiring the view. In the
whole day I only saw three people.

<p>
Luckily the ground was fairly dry, with only a couple of the boarded
sections over the bogs covering significantly wet sections. It seemed
a long way to where the path met the one coming up from Cwm Cywarch
and I didn't find any sources of water to replenish my supply. By the
time I reached the slope that leads up to Glasgwm, I was feeling a bit
dehydrated. Foolishly, I didn't walk the extra couple of hundred yards
to find the start of the stream that flows down to Cwm Cywarch, but
started off in the opposite direction to find the path that climbs up
Glasgwm.
</p>

<p>
The ascent of Glasgwm was a steep pull. The path follows the fence
almost all the way, with a steep scree section just below the
summit. Finally I saw Llyn Bach and the summit cairn. Sitting on the
cairn I could see Llyn Figyn just below the summit.
</p>

<p>
The first job was to go straight down to the lake and drink lots of
water. Once I had rehydrated, I looked around for a camp site. There
was a perfect flat grassy patch that was near to the ladder style. I
soon had the tent pitched and lay down inside to escape from the sun
for a few minutes and rest.

<p>
There was plenty of daylight left, so once I had eaten tea I set off
around the summit to explore. Although it had been a warm day, there
was very little haze. There was just enough breeze to keep the
insects away. I was quite tired, but wanted to get some pictures of
the sunset, which was around 9:30pm. Shortly after nine I got out of
the tent and wandered around taking photos. Finally I sat next to the
summit cairn and watched the sun drop below the horizon.

<p>
Crawling back into the tent, I fell asleep almost immediately. When I
woke up it was light. Glancing at my watch it was shortly after
5:00am. I had wanted to get some pictures of the sunrise, which was
just before 5:00am. Scrambling out of the tent I was just in time to
get some photos of the sun rising over Aran Fawddwy.
</p>


<p>
I made some breakfast with <a href="http://www.mountaintrails.org.uk/">Mountain Trails</a> excellent porridge and
began to pack up the tent. I didn't want to be late back and it was
obviously going to be another hot day, so I was packed up and ready to
descend shortly after 6:00am. Taking my time, so I could enjoy the
views I retraced my line of ascent along the fence. I enjoyed the
steep descent into Cwm Cywarch. The sun was beginning to illuminate
the valley and the shadows formed as it rose were making all sorts of
interesting shapes over the valley. Lost in my own thoughts I walked
straight past the car park, not realizing my mistake for about a
quarter of a mile.

I was staying with the family near to Appleby for a few days. The
cold clear weather of the last few weeks looked set to continue for a
few more days at least. I wanted to get out and walk up something,
but only had half a day to spare. I could see Cross Fell over the
other side of the valley and I can't remember when I was last up
there, so a return visit seemed in order.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't got a map, but my brother-in-law kindly lent me one. Also,
as I hadn't planned on doing any high level walking, I didn't have
any winter kit with me. From what I could see from down in the valley
most of the snow had been scoured off the slopes by the wind, so I
hope I could make my way round any patches of hard snow or ice. I
drove over to Culgaith and looked at my map to see how I would get to
Kirkland where the walk started. This was when I discovered that my
brother-in-law had given me the wrong map! A quick trip to Penrith
and a wait until 9:00am, when WH Smith opened, solved this
problem. However, it meant that getting back by 2:00pm was going to
be hard.
</p>

<p>
I parked up next to the church in Kirkland and consulted my new map
about the fastest route to the summit. I had enough clothing to keep
warm, but only my Inov8 Roclite's

I had wanted to do an overnight trip to North Wales for some time. I
am not keen on camping in the Winter months, as there is so little
daylight and I don't really want to spend 12-14hrs in the
tent. However, it's now light until about 7:00pm and sunrise is around
6:00am. This spring has seen an unusually cold spell of weather with
the tops returning to true winter conditions, as temperature remained
below freezing for many days.

<p>
I decided on a trip up Moel Siabod because I wanted to use our new
DSLR to take some night time photos and do a series of time lapse
sunset and sunrise pictures. The weather forecast seemed good with
predictions of clouds above the summits, but temperatures around -6C
at 800m.
</p>

<p>
I dropped my son off in Chester and continued round the A55 to
Llanberis. Since my mountaineering boots have worn out and I only
have crampons suitable for B3 boots, I needed to get something
suitable for my Meindl walking boots. Rather than buy another pair of
crampons I decided to get some <a href="http://www.kahtoola.com/microspikes.php">Kahtoola Microspikes</a> . These were duly
purchased from V12 and after a quick sausage sandwich in Pete's Eats
I set off for Capel Curig.

<p>
There was a sign and barriers at the bottom of the Pass saying the
road was closed. However, it looked fine to me and there as traffic
coming down. The road was clear but either side of the top of the pass
there were diggers clearing old drifts. I just followed the gritter and had
no problem getting through.
</p>

<p>
Parking near the North London Club hut I began to sort out my
rucksack. I had quite a bit of extra gear, including an ice axe the
DSLR, a tripod and an extra lens. Luckily, everything just fitted into
my POD black ice. It was above freezing in the car park, but once I
walked up the track to the farm it was back below
freezing. I had hoped to collect water from one of the lakes or a
stream, but everything was frozen solid.

<p>
Rather than climb the Ddear Ddu ridge, I had decided to climb the
steep slope at the end of the farm track, which is my normal descent
route. This has a couple of steep sections up onto the main ridge. I
stopped half way up the first of the steep sections to put on the
Microspikes. These turned out to be an excellent buy and coped with
varied conditions I encountered including iron hard neve and water
ice. After what seemed to be a long pull, I reached the ladder styles
at the start of the summit ridge. There was a very cold wind blowing
from the East, but the effort of dragging a heavy sack uphill had kept
me warm. The easterly wind had deposited loads of snow in the lee of
the ridge. There was a hard crust on top, but I broke through every
few steps, which made for very slow going. I crabbed my way round the
summit ridge until the summit trig point came into view. Just below
the summit, I spoke to a few people who were descending and when I got
to the trig point there was someone in a bothy bag next to it. I moved
over to the stone shelter, which was slightly less exposed to the wind
and ate some cake.

<p>
I had a quick look at my flat camping spot overlooking just t the
north west of the summmit. The snow wasn't too deep there, but there was quite a bit of
spindrift blowing about. Since I didn't have any water, I would have
to melt snow and the nearest convenient big drifts would be some way from
the tent. I hadn't felt too well on the ascent.
Although the cloud was well above the summits there was no sunshine,
which made for very flat contrast and there wouldn't any opportunity
to photograph the stars. As it was only
about 3:30pm I would have plenty of time to descend if I wanted to.
</p>

<p>
After considering the options for a while, I made the decision to
descend and began to retrace my tracks. Almost immediately I
experienced a pain in my right hip, which was both sharp and
nagging. Although I had fallen over a couple of times and my legs were
suffering from the effects of keeping breaking through the crust, I
couldn't recall anything specific that would cause the pain. As I
ploughed on downwards I had to take frequent rests. The microspikes
worked brilliantly on the steep descent and at no time did I feel
insecure. I had another long rest when I reached the farm track and at
increasingly frequent intervals on the way down. Finally I reached the
car, where I made myself a hot drink.
</p>

<p>
The hip didn't hurt if I was stationary, but only when I walked. After
a two hour drive home, I could barely hobble into the house. Luckily
after a nights rest it seems to have improved, so I think it's
probably just muscular.

My son is doing the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award this year. He had
a training day at Moel Famau, so I thought I would take the
opportunity to go for a walk. The weather was looking good, with
clear skies forecast all day.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the car park around 9:45am and my son went off to join
his group. I decided that I wanted to traverse the ridge to Moel
Arthur and then make my way back along the valley to Cilcain and back
over Moel Famau to the car park. However, I wasn't sure if I would
have enough time, as I only had around 5hrs before I needed to be
back.

<p>
As I climbed up the track towards the monument, I could hear the wind
blowing through the trees. There was an icy cold wind blowing around
the monument and I went round to the lee side to shelter for a few
minutes. I had a brief chat with someone while I sorted out my gear
and found my gloves. As usual there was quite a crowd round the
monument, one of the reasons I don't come here too often as I prefer
to have the hills to myself. However, once I started off along the
ridge I soon left the crowds behind.
</p>

<p>
I could make out a snow covered mountain in the distance, but it was
slightly hazy and I couldn't see any other mountains which would help
me to identify it. This was a bit of a disappointment, as I had
lugged the telephoto lens up with me in the hope of getting some
decent long distance shots. I fell into conversation with a man whose
son was currently doing the silver D of E award. We chatted for a
while and then he set off down towards the pub in Cilcain. The wind
varied in strength on different sections of the ridge and I was being
really buffeted on certain parts. I reached the start of the drop
down to the road around 11:30am, so I had plenty of time to go over
to Moel Arthur, as I didn't have to be back until around 3:30pm.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the road, I took a direct line up to the summit Moel Arthur
where there is a small pile of stones marking the top. I couldn't see
any sign of the ancient hill fort. I decided to eat lunch on the summit
event though it was windy and there was no shelter. I sat with my
back to the wind, but one big gust blew the hot chocolate out of my
cup.
</p>

<p>
I decided not to bother trying to return along the valley to
Cilcain. The last time I had done this route the path was unclear in
places and I had to negotiate a high sheep fence on the edge of a
steep bank. Also, I much preferred being up on the ridge than down in
the valley. In any case the views are always different if you do the
walk the other way round!
</p>

<p>
Rather than follow my direct line of ascent on the way down, I stuck
to the path that initially heads off NE and then contours back round
the hill down to the road. Once back on the main ridge, I was walking
directly into the wind. I stopped for another drink and Kit Kat by
the cairn at SJ 1502963255. The wind was very strong on this part of
the ridge and the cairn provided only partial shelter. I was soon
back at the monument and retrace my route of ascent back to the car,
arriving about 2:30pm in good time to meet my son.

After my walk over Moel Famau and Moel Arthur I was looking forward
to making a hot drink. My brew kit lives permanently in the boot of
the truck, so I don't forget to take it with me! I unpacked my Primus
Gravity stove from its pouch and connected up a gas cylinder.
</p>

<p>
I use a
Light My Fire <a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/products/sparking-fire-collection/swedish-firesteel-20.aspx">Swedish Fire Steel</a> rather than matches or a
lighter. This will generate a spark under almost any conditions and
doesn't run out of gas, or refuse to light when soggy, like lighters
and, matches. I keep it in a small zipped section of the pouch that
the stove lives in. I pulled it out, so I coud light the stove and
noticed that the steel was now only about half an inch long! I
thought that it must have somehow got broken, but looking inside the
pouch there was nothing but a pile of grey dust. Luckily there was
just enough left to generate a spark and light my stove.
</p>

<p>
When I got home I spent some time Googling and found that other
people had had similar problems: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pfZAcPq3o">here</a> and there was a possible
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhPyig4ra40">explanation</a> . It would appear that contact with inorganic salts and
water can make the fire steel, which is made from an alloy called
Ferrocerium, can act as a battery. This results in the fire steel
corroding away. The bag containing my steel may well have been
slightly damp, but as far as I know it hadn't come into contact with
any salt solutions unless something spilt on the bag had soaked through.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, lesson learned. Always check your fire steel before setting
out. Even something you think couldn't possibly fail can do so in an
unexpected way.

The West coast of Ireland is great for cycling. The coastal scenery
is spectacular and the roads are quiet. This circular route takes the
??? peninsula just south of Clifden. It's worth noting the wind
direction before starting out, as it can often be quite breezy and a
bit of advance planning will minimize the distance you are peddling
into the wind. This was to be a family ride.
</p>

<p>
We parked in a layby just outside Ballyconneely, but there are
numerous parking places all around the route. In fact you could
easily start from Clifden. We decided to cycle anti-clockwise, which
meant that on the day the first part of the ride was into the
wind. As is often the case in Ireland, the weather was fickle and
there were frequent sharp showers. We had planned to stop at one of
the beaches before we reached Roundstone, but decided to press
on. Shortly before Roundstone there is a bit of an ascent, followed
by a nice long descent to the beach at Gurteen Bay.
</p>

<p>
The girls were getting fed up of peddling into the wind and getting
soaked on a regular basis. We agreed that they would stop in
Roundstone and I would continue around the rest of the loop and fetch
the car. I set off only pausing in Roundstone to buy some
chocolate. The town is in idyllic spot next to the sea.
</p>

<p>
I thought that the section of the ride from Roundstone was the
highlight. After following the road along the coast you take a left
turn and climb up over the moors of Roundstone Bog. There are great
views of the Twelve Bens to the North. The ground either side of the
road is very boggy and there are hundreds of small pools. This section
of the ride is very exposed and wouldn't be a good place to be in
really bad weather. The wind was now behind me, which only increased
my enjoyment of this section of the ride.
</p>

<p>
Soon I reached the junction with the main road from Clifden. Shortly
after you rejoin the road, you can follow a track up to the left,
which takes you to the Alcock and Brown landing site. THey were the
first people to fly over the Atlantic and given the nature of the
terrain it's amazing that they weren't killed on landing. The track
takes you up to the site of the old Marconi radio station and a large
concrete obelisk commemorating the flight. The actual landing site is
about 500m from the obelisk. If you want to visit it, be prepared for
some bog trotting and wet feet.
</p>

<p>
I cycled back along the track to rejoin the main road and was soon
back at Ballyconneely. By the time I had driven over to Roundstone
the girls had set off and I caught up with them just as they turned
off to Roundstone Bog.

The route is described starting from Whitchurch, but since it's
circular, you could start from anywhere. There is only one short
steep hill between Tittenley and Calverhall. Apart from Whitchurch,
which does have some cycle lanes, most of the route is on quiet
country lanes.
</p>

<p>
From Whitchurch turn up Claypit Street, which is just before the new
Sainsbury. Alternatively, you can follow Sustrans Route 45. The road
leads slowly uphill past a cemetary and the ??? camping farm. A
downhill section leads to a left hand bend, where you take the road
(Ossmere Lane) on the right. Shortly after crossing the railway you
will join Sustrans Route 45, which comes in from the right. If you
look in the hedge on the left hand side your will see ???? Mercian
statue.
</p>

<p>
At the T junction turn right into Hollyhurst road. You will be able to
see and obelisk to your right, which is a war memorial in the grounds
of Combermere Abbey. Shortly before you go underneath he railway,
there is a style and a grassy area on the right, which provides a
convenient stopping place to eat and drink. Immediately after you go
under the railway bridge turn right and then a short distance further
on turn right again at a fork in the road. You are now on Sustrnas
route 70. This will lead you through Aston, past the corn mills, to the main Whitchurch -
Nantwich road. Cross this and head off along Shepenhall Lane. Ignore
all the turnings to the left and right. Just after you cross over a
brook Shepenhall Lane changes into Rookery Lane.
</p>

<p>
Cross over the main road to Audlem and follow Royals Green
Lane. After half a mile or so, you will come to a T junction opposite
the end of Wilkesley Wood. Turn left along Wilkesley Lane and cycle
through the hamlet of Wilkesley. After about a mile and a half, at
the end of a long red brick wall you will pass the two lodges which
were one of the entrances to the Shavington Estate. Carry on along
the road until it bends sharply to the left. At this point you need
to take the lane to the right, which leads past the large pool at
Tittenley, on your left hand side.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after passing the Tittenley pool there are another two lodges,
which mark what used to be another entrance to the Shavington
Estate. Turn up the lane to the right, which is the only real climb on
this route. It doesn't last very long and leads you to another T
junction. Turn right here (signposted Calverhall). After half a mile
of so you will pass the grand iron gates, which were the main entrance
to the Shavington Estate. Carry on until you reach the small village
of Calverhall. The Jack pub on the left is well worth a visit and
serves good food and beer.
</p>

<p>
Turn right at the T junction and cycle into Ightfield. There is a
convenient brick bus shelter here, which is a good place to eat your
sandwiches if it's raining. Follow the bend round to the left. Just
on the right there is a large grassy playground, with a couple of
benches. This is a nice place to eat your sandwiches in good weather!
</p>

<p>
The road continues on into the two villages of Ash. It's a short easy
climb and there is a nice duck pond where you can linger. From Ash the
road descends to meet the Whitchurch bypass. Cross straight over the
roundabout and enter a small industrial estate. Carry straight on at
the apex of the sharp left hand bend which allows you to regain the
old main road into Whitchurch, via a short stretch of footpath. From
here it's only a short ride back to the town centre.
