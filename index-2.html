For a few years I have worn Craghopper Kiwi trousers almost all the
time. I am in the lucky position of being able to wear whatever I want
most of the time, so I tend to choose clothes that are both practical
and I feel comfortable in.
</p>

<p>
The Kiwi's are great and if you shop around you can pick them up for
around £25, rather than the rrp. of £40. They are reasonably wind
proof and dry very quickly when wet. However, one problem is that they
also get wet very quickly in a shower, or if you brush against
something like wet bracken.
</p>

<p>
If it's really cold I have my Buffalo salopettes, but at anything
above freezing they are far too warm. I wanted something that was more
water resistant than the Kiwis, but not too warm to wear in Spring and
Autumn. Initially I considered the Paramo Cascadas, but decided that
these were probably too bulky and heavy for me.
</p>

<p>
There are a bewildering number of "Mountain Trousers" available at
various price points. I made a short list of desirable properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reasonably windproof and light.</li>

<li>Water resistant.</li>

<li>Articulated knees so I could use them for scrambling and climbing.</li>

<li>Hard wearing - I tend to use my gear a lot and want it to last.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I read numerous reviews and trawled various forums looking for
advice. Eventually, I settled on Mammut Base Jumps. They had many
positive reviews and are available in a wide range of sizes - I have
long legs, so wanted to make sure I didn't end up with something that
was too short. However, just when I decided what I wanted, Mammut
decided to discontinue the original Base Jump and bring out a new
model. No on in the UK had a pair available in my size.
</p>

<p>
When the new design became available, it was even more expensive than
the already expensive old Base Jumps. Luckily, I found out that I
could buy Mammut Champs, which are basically  the same as the Base
Jumps, but more expensive. They were now cheaper than the new range of
Base Jumps. I took a deep breath and bought a pair of Champs from V12,
who are the main distributor in the UK. The price of £116 was more
than I have ever paid for a pair of trousers before.
</p>

<p>
I was initially very uncertain about paying so much for a pair of
trousers. However, having worn them a number of times I am very hapy
with them. They are very comfortable and whilst not completely wind
proof, the fabric is very breathable so I don't sweat. This makes them
great for both walking and cycling. I hate waterproof over trousers
and though I have a pair I almost never wear them. The Champs are
water resistant to the extent that I don't bother carrying my
waterproof over trousers, thus saving some weight. I think that rain
heavy enough to soak the Champs would get through over trousers too.
</p>

<p>
The bottoms are expandable, so the trousers will fit if you are
wearing big boots in winter. There are two zip pockets and a single
large thigh pocket. The material seems to be durable, time will tell
how long it lasts.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4d6a0b0">
<p>
I have always liked the idea of spending a night on the summit of Moel
Siabod. The views over Snowdonia and the other Welsh mountains to the
south are unrivalled. In the recent spell of settled fine weather I
decided it was time to actually go and do it.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Moel Siabod from the end of the farm track.</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/2010-04_moel_siabod/Siabod_from_farm_track.jpg" class="rounded

<p>
I arrived in Capel Curig about 4:30pm and parked in the small car park
at Bryn Glo. I packed my sack and started walking along the A5
crossing the bridge at Pont Cyfyng. I walked up the farm track,
familiar from many past ascents of Siabod, reaching the final ladder
style at the end of the track. It was sunny and the sky was almost
clear, but there was a slight haze.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Ddear Ddu Ridge.</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/2010-04_moel_siabod/Ddear_Ddu_ridge.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Ddear Ddu Ridge."><img src="galleries/2010-04_moel_siabod/Ddear_Ddu_ridge.jpg"></a></b>



<p>
My intention was to walk up past Lyn y Foel and ascend the Ddear Ddu
Ridge to the summit. However, when I reached the lake the shore was
very wet and boggy after the snowy winter. I traversed along a good
path on the headwall above the lake, thinking that I could climb up
onto the ridge about half way up. I made my way up to the foot of the
ridge and began climbing up what looked like a good way onto the
crest. However, the final hundred feet up a steep corner filled with
grass proved harder than expected. I was carrying quite a heavy sack
and it all felt very insecure. I wimped out and climbed back down,
traversing back to the path. The path continued directly up a gully
filled with loose scree. It wasn't difficult, but it was unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
Finally I emerged on the summit ridge close to the summit trig point. I
hadn't stopped all the way up was very hot and sweaty. I sat just
below the trig point, sheltered from a cool breeze to drink a Fruit
Shoot and eat a couple of almond slices. I left the sack close to the
stone shelter, just below the trig point and reconnoitred for a good
camp site. There was a cool north easterly breeze, but the forecast
was good and no high winds were predicted.
</p>

<p>
There is a nice flat grassy area just to the north west of the summit
shelter, which is where I decided to pitch the tent. By the time I had
got the tent pitched and unpacked my gear it was getting very cold. I
boiled some water to make a hot chocolate and to rehydrate my pasta
and cheese meal. It was now cold enough that I needed to wear all my
layers, plus gloves to stop my hands freezing.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>The Tent and Sunset over Snowdon.</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/2010-04_moel_siabod/Tent_and_sunset_over_snowdon.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="The Tent and Sunset over Snowdon."><img src="galleries/2010-04_moel_siabod/Tent_and_sunset_over_snowdon.jpg"></a></b>



<p>
The sun was rapidly disappearing, so I wandered round taking some
photos. I also managed to get a couple of pictures of myself outside the
tent by perching the phone on a rock and using the self timer. I
retreated inside the tent and got into my sleeping bag to warm myself
up. Surprisingly, there was good T-Mobile coverage on the summit, so I
sent a couple of photos from the phone back home.
</p>

<p>
When I had warmed up I went back outside the tent. By now it was
completely dark. The sky was clear and I could see the bright lights
of what I presumed was Bangor in the distance. The clear sky and north
easterly breeze mean that it had now got very cold. My fingers were
numb within a few seconds of removing my gloves, so I scuttled back
inside the tent and got back into my sleeping bag.
</p>

<p>
This was the first outing from my Thermarest Neoair. I was surprised
at just how comfortable it was, definitely a good purchase. I drifted
in and out of sleep finally getting up about 5:30am. Sunrise was
supposedly shortly after 6:00am, but I could see a red glow on the
horizon. It had been cold outside the tent during the night. My little
keyring thermometer showed that it was around -4C and the outside of
the tent was covered in a layer of ice.
</p>

<p>

<p class="caption"><b>Sunrise.</b></p>

<p>
Stupidly I had left the stove outside the tent. Even though I was
using Coleman Propane/Butane mix there wasn't enough pressure to work
the stove properly. I stuck the canister in my sleeping bag for 10
mins and tried again. This time it worked fine. My Primus Spider stove
has a pre-heating coil, so once the stove was lit it was soon roaring
away. I made a cup of hot chocolate and had some more almond slices. I
wandered around taking more photos. The sky was completely clear and
yesterdays evening haze had completely dispersed. The valleys to the
south of Siabod were filled with mist, but those to the north were
clear.
</p>

<p>
I hung around for about an hour waiting for it to get a bit warmer
before packing up and descending the north east ridge to the farm
track. I got back to the car about 8:45am and drove round to Llanberis
for a well deserved breakfast in Pete's Eats.

<p>
In the last couple of months I have been buying some new
walking/climbing gear. Quite a bit of my outdoor clothing is getting
rather battered and worn out (a bit like me). In the past I have used
a tee shirt/fleece/Goretex jacket layering system.
</p>

<p>
For cold weather I have a complete Buffalo system, which was very
kindly given to me by Hamish Hamilton about 20 years ago. For cold
snowy conditions e.g. Scotland/Alps this is excellent and I am sure
that it will last a few more years yet. However, once the temperature
gets above freezing it's far too hot, even with maximum venting.
</p>

<p>
In the last couple of months I have bought a couple of Paramo tops,
which keep my nice and warm when I am walking or cycling. However, if
it's very windy, or when I stop for a while I need something to put
over the top. I do have a Buffalo belay jacket, but that's far too
warm and bulky. In the past I have packed a fleece jacket in my sack,
but even that was relatively heavy and bulky.
</p>

<p>
A couple of weeks ago I noticed a <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/primaloft/generator_smock---85/">Rab Generator Smock</a> in the sale at
<a href="http://www.joe-brown.com/">Joe Brown's</a>  in Llanberis. This has a Pertex Quantum inner and outer
with Primaloft 1 fill. Primaloft is a man made fibre, similar to
down. However, unlike down it doesn't transform itself into a soggy
lump when it gets damp. The smock weighs around 330 grammes and packs
up into its own chest pocket, so I am happy to carry it with me all
the time.
</p>

<p>
I gave in to temptation and bought one. I am very glad that I did.

This week we have spent a few days in North Wales. We were very lucky
with the weather - it was cold and clear. Following a day walking we
wanted to do a short cycle ride. The children wanted it to be traffic
free and flat!
</p>

<p>
This ride, which is approximately four miles long, follows a
dismantled railway along the Menai Straight to the old port of
Dinorwig. There are good views over the Menai Straight to the island
of Anglesey.
</p>

<h2 id="org2425417">Starting Point and Route.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2425417">
<p>
I am assuming that you start in Caernarfon, but you could of course
start in Dinorwig. You can park at the Victoria Dock next to the
Castle. Follow the one way system around the Castle and look out for
signs for Lon Las Menai, National Cycle Route 8. The route takes you
through the town to the Morrisons car park. There is alteernative
parking next to this, behind the old church, which is now a children's
play centre.
</p>

<p>
Descend from the Morrisons car park onto the old track next to the
Menai Straight. It's now simply a matter of following this to Y
Felinheli. Cycle along the waterfront towards the town to the Garddion
Inn. From the outside this looks quite run down. However, inside it's
very friendly with lots of interesting old photos and serves very good
food.
</p>

<p>
The return journey involves retracing your route back to Caernarfon.

Mynydd Mawr is an outlier of the Moel Hebog group and is situated
between Snowdon and the Nantlle Ridge. It's not very high - 698m or
2269ft, but because of it's position the views from the top are
spectacular.
</p>

<p>
Most people start from Rhyd Ddu, the route going past the Craig y
Bera, which has the excellent climb Angel Pavement. However, we were
staying in the adjacent valley at <a href="http://www.tycochsnowdonia.co.uk/">Hen Ysgubor</a>, which is at the foot of
the mountain, so that's where I started my climb.
</p>

<p>
Please note that you can't follow the exact route I describe unless
you are staying in the house, as it crosses farmland belonging to the
house. However, it's possible to start on the road between Waunfawr
and Rhosgadfan (SH  514583).
</p>

<p>
From Hen Ysgubor I walked up the fields behind the house to reach the
edge of the trees at approximately 532566.
</p>

<p>
From the top of the first steep rise trending generally left brings
you out to a stone wall at !!!!! It's possible to cross the wall in
the corner of the field via the stone sheepfold (528559) by going
through the holes under the wall. There are also several big flat
stones on top of the wall at various points. If you are very careful
not to damage the wall, you can climb over the wall.
</p>

<p>
The track up the Eastern slope (not marked on the map) of the mountain
is obvious from here. There is a steep pull up to some old mine
workings, surrounded by a fence (be careful not to fall in). The path
continues steeply upwards and contours along the edge of Craig Cwm
Du. These vegetated cliffs provide some good Winter climbs in
suitable, but rare, conditions.
</p>

<p>
As you reach the top the path becomes fainter and you need to bear
right. In poor visibility you will probably need to use your
compass. It seems a long pull up to the summit, which isn't visible
until your are about a hundred yards away. However, once you get there
the views are stunning. Like Moel Siabod, Mynydd Mawr is an isolated
summit and so provides extensive views of the other peaks. On one side
you have the Nantlle Ridge and on the other Snowdon and the
Glyders. There are also good views over Caernarfon and Anglesey.
</p>

<p>
From the summit you can descend to Rhydd Ddu, or simply retrace your steps.

I had passed the Clwydian range hundreds of times on the way to
Snowdonia, but I had never climbed any of its hills. Amongst other
things the hills are famous for the range of iron Age hill forts, with
six forts along the crest of the ridge. The crest of the ridge is
heather moorland and Offa's Dyke path follows almost the entire ridge.
</p>


<p>
The weather forecast predicted a cold, clear day, so I decided to
Cilcain for a walk up Moel Arthur and then along the ridge to Moel
Famau, the highest top.
</p>

<p>
I had found an interesting route that traversed the ridge from Moel
Arhtur to Moel Famau on the <a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/2509/">Walking Britain</a> website. I drove to the
start of the route in Cilcain, which is just off the main Mold to
Denbigh road. I stopped briefly in the car park opposite the church
which has a notice stating "The gate may be locked at any time”. The
Walking Britain site suggests that you drive down the lane next to the
church over a stream and park near to the tree by the large grey steel
framed building, so that's what I did. There was quite a bit of space
and only one other car there.
</p>

<p>
I parked up and started heating some water for a flask using my new
Primus Gravity II stove. I was using a Coleman's gas cylinder, which
is a propane/butane mix, so even though the temperature wasn't much
above freezing the water was soon boiling.
</p>

<p>
From the car I walked back into Cilcain and then took the path
opposite the church running North West on the right hand side of the
car park. I followed the path over a few stiles and arrived at a small
lane. On the way I passed several clumps of snowdrops, a nice sign
that Spring can't be too far away. Careful study of the map showed
that I need to turn left, walk a few yards and then follow a small
lane off to the right down a hill.
</p>

<p>
I followed the lane until reached a T junction, where I climbed over
the stile directly in front of me. The path continued in more or less
a straight line over several fields. When I reached a small wood on
the left, I went diagonally to the right hand corner of the
field. There I had a short chat with two people hanging a gate. I
wasn't sure about the way ahead, but there was a yellow waymark
pointing along the line of the fence to the left. I continued along
the line of the fence, through some very boggy ground and crossed the
stream via some convenient stones without getting my feet wet. I
turned left, expecting to find a gate after a short distance. However,
there was a new looking fence made from pig netting and barbed, with
no apparent way through. I walked backwards and forwards along the
fence a couple of times, but couldn't find an easy way over or
through. Luckily, I found an empty feed bucket and by standing on top
of this I was able to get over the fence.
</p>

<p>
I crossed the field and found the stile in the hedge by the road at
grid ref. SJ162670.  I climbed over the stile and went in a generally
leftwards direction to cross over a stream. Once over the stream, I
followed the path straight up the hill into the corner of the wood. I
continued along the path straight ahead for a short distance and then
took the forestry track to the left, which led uphill. This lead to a
gate at grid ref. SJ156677, with a wooden horse jump to its left. I
climbed over the jump and turned left along the wide path, which
skirted the woods to my left. The views from the path were extensive,
as I was on the crest of a ridge. Eventually, the path started to drop
down towards the car park at grid ref. 147657. I should have turned
right here and carried on up the eastern slope of Moel Arthur to the
summit, but I carried on along the path. About two thirds of the way
down to the car park I realized my mistake, so I cut directly back up
the side of Moel Arthur to the summit.
</p>

<p>
After taking a few photos I made my way back down the slope to the car
park, which was quite busy. I crossed the road and started to make my
way directly up the hill opposite. The path goes up through a small
gully, which was still full of snow. I stopped just below the snow and
had a chat with a man who was in the process of putting on a pair of
small crampons. I reached the snow, which turned out to be iron hard
neve. Luckily there was a ladder of steps and the slope was short.
</p>

<p>
Once I reached the ridge there were views of Snowdon, Cadair Idris,
the North Wales coast. I could see snow on the peaks on Snowdonia, but
Cader seemed to be snow free. I followed the path along the crest of
the ridge towards Moel Famau. I wished that I had brought my
binoculars to help me identify all the towns, buildings and hills I
could see. Out to the West were the mountains of Snowdonia, whilst
over to the East most of Merseyside was clearly visible.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to be back home by 4:00pm and I wasn't sure how long it would
take me to get back to the car, so I didn't stop until I got to the
Jubilee Tower on Moel Famau. Apparently, this was built to celebrate
the 50th year of George III's reign, but it was never completed. I sat
under the North side of the tower, which was sheltered from the breeze
and ate my lunch.
</p>

<p>
From the tower I walked short distance to the North East. Once away
from the shelter of the tower I was exposed to the very cold North
Easterly breeze. I joined the descent path, which dropped down steeply
North Eastwards along the left hand side of a wood and once I reached
the wood I was sheltered from the cold wind. I reached a small finger
post where my path crossed a track. I carried straight on down hill
making for the left hand side of the reservoir below. Following the
path beside the reservoir, I reached a gate at the end of the lane.
Walking along the lane brought me out next to the car. It was 2:30pm,
so I just had time to make another cup of hot chocolate before I set
off for home.

I have only recently discovered bothy bags. For many years I have been
carrying round my Wild Country Goretex bivvy bag in the winter
time. I have used it many times for planned bivvies and a few times for
unplanned ones.
</p>

<p>
Now that I take the children into the mountains, I wanted some sort of
emergency shelter. Buying five Goretex bivvy bags wasn't really an
option, especially as I would have to carry them all. Reading various
outdoor web sites, I saw bothy bags mentioned. For the other person in
the world who hasn't heard of them, they are essentially a large
waterproof tent, with no ground sheet. They are made of very thin
material, pack into a small sack and weight 500g or less.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Using the
  Bothy Bag in the Shropshire Hills.</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/bothy_bag.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt="Using the Bothy Bag in the Shropshire Hills."><img src="galleries/bothy_bag.jpg"></a></b>



<p>
The theory is that you pull the bag over your head and sit on the
small "seat" at the bottom. The "seat" is just a bit of material,
whose primary purpose is to keep your bum dry and prevent the shelter
blowing away. The fabric stops the wind and rain getting in and helps
stop body heat leaking out. Although bothy bags can be used by one
person, they are most effective when used by two or more people, as
this generates a warm micro-climate inside the bag.
</p>

<p>
The simplest form of bag is just waterproof material. However, you can
get bags with windows and pockets, into which you can slot walking
poles to help suspend the shelter. Bags are available in various sizes
which will accommodate groups from two to twenty.
</p>

<p>
Since there are five of us, I ended up buying a bag suitable for four,
reckoning that I could fit two adults and three children inside. You
don't need to wait for an emergency to use your bothy bag, they make
great lunch shelters. I recently used mine on Moel Siabod in freezing
rain, and a high wind. I was warm and comfortable and I wished that I
had bought a bothy shelter years ago!
</p>

<p>
The shelter that I bought was a Terra Nova Bothy 4. This has a couple
of windows and slots for trekking poles. A nice touch is that the
stuff sack is permanently attached to the bag, so it won't blow away
or get lost.

We often go to the Lake District in the October half term for a short
break. At that time of year the hours of daylight are short and the
weather can be dreadful. However, the autumn colours are always worth
seeing and sometimes you get those cold clear days when you can see
for miles.

<p>
This year we were staying at the <a href="http://www.lairbeckhotel-keswick.co.uk/">Lairbeck Hotel</a> in Keswick. This is a
very friendly small hotel in a Victorian house. The great advantage
for us is that they have a room large enough for all five of us to
share.
</p>

<p>
The weather forecast for the three days we were staying was very bad,
with visibility on the fells predicted to be zero with heavy
rain. Luckily for the first two days the weather turned out to be much
better than the forecast.
</p>

<p>
On the second day we decided to climb Skiddaw, as it was close to
Keswick and not too strenuous. I had climbed it once before in the
1970's and remember the walk as being pretty boring, but with good
views back over Keswick.
</p>

<p>
Rather than walking from the hotel, we cheated by driving up to the
car park at Latrigg. The tops were clear and it didn't look as though
it was going to rain in the next few hours.
</p>

<p>
As we plodded along the path towards the summit ridge the wind was
gradually increasing in force. Rather than continue plodding all the
way to the main summit, we turned off at the fence at the top of
Jenkin Hill and headed up to Little Man. The last few feet to the
summit were exposed to the full force of the gale. I had trouble
staying on my feet, even though I was carrying a fairly heavy
sack. Ella was blown off her feet a couple of times. We sat down next
to the rusty remains of the old fence posts and I took a couple of
photos. It would have been dangerous to continue along the summit
ridge, as there was a distinct possibility of Ella being blown off. We
dropped back down to the path at Jenkin Hill and were soon out of the
worst of the wind.
