We often go to the Lake District in the October half term for a short
break. At that time of year the hours of daylight are short and the
weather can be dreadful. However, the autumn colours are always worth
seeing and sometimes you get those cold clear days when you can see
for miles.

This year we were staying at the [[http://www.lairbeckhotel-keswick.co.uk/][Lairbeck Hotel]] in Keswick. This is a
very friendly small hotel in a Victorian house. The great advantage
for us is that they have a room large enough for all five of us to
share.

The weather forecast for the three days we were staying was very bad,
with visibility on the fells predicted to be zero with heavy
rain. Luckily for the first two days the weather turned out to be much
better than the forecast.

On the second day we decided to climb Skiddaw, as it was close to
Keswick and not too strenuous. I had climbed it once before in the
1970's and remember the walk as being pretty boring, but with good
views back over Keswick.

Rather than walking from the hotel, we cheated by driving up to the
car park at Latrigg. The tops were clear and it didn't look as though
it was going to rain in the next few hours.

As we plodded along the path towards the summit ridge the wind was
gradually increasing in force. Rather than continue plodding all the
way to the main summit, we turned off at the fence at the top of
Jenkin Hill and headed up to Little Man. The last few feet to the
summit were exposed to the full force of the gale. I had trouble
staying on my feet, even though I was carrying a fairly heavy
sack. Ella was blown off her feet a couple of times. We sat down next
to the rusty remains of the old fence posts and I took a couple of
photos. It would have been dangerous to continue along the summit
ridge, as there was a distinct possibility of Ella being blown off. We
dropped back down to the path at Jenkin Hill and were soon out of the
worst of the wind.
