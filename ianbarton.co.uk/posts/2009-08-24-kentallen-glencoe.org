The Oban to Fort William Cycle trail seems to be one of the best kept
secrets in Scotland. I only found out about it because we were staying
at Kentallen right next to it. It is supposed to be a flagship trail,
but there was almost no information available locally, or on the
web. The trail isn't complete, but the section between Kentallen and
Ballachulish is finished.

We started our ride next to the
[[http://www.hollytreehotel.co.uk/][Holly Tree Hotel]] in
Kentallen. The trail winds its way along the shores of Loch Linnhe. It
emerges next to Ballachulish bridge, where you can cross over to
Glenachulish. There are great view over the lake to Ardgour and
Glencoe. From the end of the track it's possible to follow a forestry
track from the car park in Glenachulish towards Ballachulish. The
track climbs up into the glen. There are two alternatives, depending
on how far up the glen you want to cycle. The track is stony in
places, but quite navigable on ordinary road bikes. Be warned that the
"easy" variation involves some 400ft of climbing. However, the views
more than compensate for the climb!

We had to cycle back to Kentallen and I was a bit concerned that the
children wouldn't want to go back up the forestry track. However, they
had enjoyed the descent so much, they were happy to climb back up the
track again.
