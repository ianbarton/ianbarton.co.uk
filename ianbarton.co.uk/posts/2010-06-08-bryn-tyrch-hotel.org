When I was a small child, in the 1960's, we often stayed at Cobdens in
Capel Curig. The hotel was then owned by a Mrs Newman, who also owned
the Tyn y Coed just down the road. I think that she also owned the
hotel on the A5 at Pentrefoelas. She lived in the house opposite to
Cobdens, by the green bridge over the river. Cobdens was always a bit
ramshackle, but in a nice sort of way.

In the 1970's Cobdens had really gone down hill and my parents started
to stay up the road at the [[http://www.bryntyrchinn.co.uk/][Bryn Tyrch]] . By this time I had left home,
so didn't stay there with them, but often called to have a meal with
them when my weekend trips to North Wales coincided with theirs. Over
the years I have drunk countless pints of beer and eaten innumerable
bar meals at the Bryn Tyrch. Recently the hotel has been refurbished and
the standard and choice of food has been greatly improved. There are
still the old photographs, taken by the guidebook author [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._A._Poucher][WA Poucher]],
who use to stay here.

We have three children and now that they are getting older, we tend
not to stay in hotels and guest houses, as we can no longer all fit in
one room, so it can work out very expensive. However, it turns out the
Bryn Tyrch has a couple of bunk rooms inside the hotel, which meant
that we could fit in one room and the children had a room to
themselves. The food was excellent, importantly there were things that
the children would eat available in child size portions.

The standard of the rooms was very good, with excellent
breakfasts. The staff are also family friendly and the price for B&B
for all five of us very reasonable. The location of the hotel in Capel
Curig is ideal for visiting all parts of Snowdonia. In fact you can
start many walks from the hotel itself, so you don't have to drive at
all. I am sure that we shall be staying there again.
