I haven't included what I would be wearing, which would usually
include a Rab Vapour Ride Lite jacket. In hot weather this would go
inside the rucksack. In warm weather I wear Rab Treklite trousers. In
cooler weather I wear my Mammut Base Jumps.

This is what I would typically take on a Spring/Autumn trip. In
summer, if the forecast was good, I wouldn't take either the cagoule,
or the waterproof over trousers, but would substitute either a Montane
???? or Marmot Dr-Clime windshirt.

I prefer to camp high up, so it's usually chilly in the evening and
early mornings. The Montane prism jacket, worn over my base layer
keeps me nice and warm. The Montane prism trousers
