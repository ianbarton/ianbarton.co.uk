[[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-erddig][Erddig]] is owned by the National Trust, to whom it was bequeathed by
the last Squire, Philip Yorke. The Yorke family maintained a
fascinating collection of portraits and photographs of people who
worked on the estate. Outside there is a formal garden and landscaped
park.

It is possible to do a short ride completely within the
grounds. However, the ride can easily be extended along the quiet
country lanes surrounding Erddig. You can hire cycles, including
tandems, for very reasonable rates. The last time we went we hired a
tandem for two of our children, which they really enjoyed riding. The
cycle hire shop is within the property itself, so if you are not a
National Trust member, you will have to pay to access the
shop. However, you could also take the opportunity to look round the
house and formal gardens. The park land surrounding the formal gardens
is freely accessible, so if you bring your own bikes you can do the
rides without paying to enter the house.

The hire shop has a leaflet which shows a couple of rides of about 3
miles through the grounds and along the local lanes. We did both these
one after the other on a sunny day.
