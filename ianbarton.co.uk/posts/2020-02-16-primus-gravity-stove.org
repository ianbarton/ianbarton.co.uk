I have had this stove for a number of years. I don't often camp in full winter
conditions, but do often camp on a summit where the temperature can be close to
freezing at night. The Primus Gravity has a preheating coil, so it can be used
in cold conditions. To get decent performance in the cold you need a gas canister
with a propane/butane mix.

My stove came with a foil heat screen,heat reflector (goes underneath the
stove), a fixed igniter and a bag. On my stove the igniter was attached to the
stove and melted after a couple of uses. The latest version of this stove comes
with a separate igniter. The tin foil of the windscreen broke into pieces after
being folded/unfolded a few times and I now use an Alpkit wind shield. The
stove has fold out legs, which makes stable even with a large pot.

Apart from the minor whinges described above, I love the stove. It has
performed faultlessly over the years. In addition to camping trips, I keep the
stove in the back of my truck for making brews. The canister connects via a
decent size flexible hose. It's not as light as a canister top stove, but for
me the extra stability and ability to use the stove in cold conditions make the
extra weight worthwhile.
