A New Year and time for some changes. This blog has got something of
a mixture of technology related posts and posts about the outdoors. I
have decided to start a new blog at http://ianbarton.net to which is
going to be about technology. This blog will be where I post all my
outdoors related content. I have started by moving all the technology
related posts from this blog over to the new one.

There are a lot of gear related reviews, which are scattered around. I
am planning to make an index page to make it easier to find a
review. I'll also be adding an index page for my backpacking posts and
I hope to add a gpx file and map for each post.
