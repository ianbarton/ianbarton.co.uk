The route is described starting from Whitchurch, but since it's
circular, you could start from anywhere. There is only one short
steep hill between Tittenley and Calverhall. Apart from Whitchurch,
which does have some cycle lanes, most of the route is on quiet
country lanes.

From Whitchurch turn up Claypit Street, which is just before the new
Sainsbury. Alternatively, you can follow Sustrans Route 45. The road
leads slowly uphill past a cemetary and the ??? camping farm. A
downhill section leads to a left hand bend, where you take the road
(Ossmere Lane) on the right. Shortly after crossing the railway you
will join Sustrans Route 45, which comes in from the right. If you
look in the hedge on the left hand side your will see ???? Mercian
statue.

At the T junction turn right into Hollyhurst road. You will be able to
see and obelisk to your right, which is a war memorial in the grounds
of Combermere Abbey. Shortly before you go underneath he railway,
there is a style and a grassy area on the right, which provides a
convenient stopping place to eat and drink. Immediately after you go
under the railway bridge turn right and then a short distance further
on turn right again at a fork in the road. You are now on Sustrnas
route 70. This will lead you through Aston, past the corn mills, to the main Whitchurch -
Nantwich road. Cross this and head off along Shepenhall Lane. Ignore
all the turnings to the left and right. Just after you cross over a
brook Shepenhall Lane changes into Rookery Lane.

Cross over the main road to Audlem and follow Royals Green
Lane. After half a mile or so, you will come to a T junction opposite
the end of Wilkesley Wood. Turn left along Wilkesley Lane and cycle
through the hamlet of Wilkesley. After about a mile and a half, at
the end of a long red brick wall you will pass the two lodges which
were one of the entrances to the Shavington Estate. Carry on along
the road until it bends sharply to the left. At this point you need
to take the lane to the right, which leads past the large pool at
Tittenley, on your left hand side.

Shortly after passing the Tittenley pool there are another two lodges,
which mark what used to be another entrance to the Shavington
Estate. Turn up the lane to the right, which is the only real climb on
this route. It doesn't last very long and leads you to another T
junction. Turn right here (signposted Calverhall). After half a mile
of so you will pass the grand iron gates, which were the main entrance
to the Shavington Estate. Carry on until you reach the small village
of Calverhall. The Jack pub on the left is well worth a visit and
serves good food and beer.

Turn right at the T junction and cycle into Ightfield. There is a
convenient brick bus shelter here, which is a good place to eat your
sandwiches if it's raining. Follow the bend round to the left. Just
on the right there is a large grassy playground, with a couple of
benches. This is a nice place to eat your sandwiches in good weather!

The road continues on into the two villages of Ash. It's a short easy
climb and there is a nice duck pond where you can linger. From Ash the
road descends to meet the Whitchurch bypass. Cross straight over the
roundabout and enter a small industrial estate. Carry straight on at
the apex of the sharp left hand bend which allows you to regain the
old main road into Whitchurch, via a short stretch of footpath. From
here it's only a short ride back to the town centre.
