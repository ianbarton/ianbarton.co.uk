I have never had a map case before. In fact I always thought of them
as a bit naff. However, after more than thirty years of stopping to
get the map out of the top pocket of my rucksack and then struggling
to fold it in the wind, I finally decided that it was time I bought a
map case.

I did some research on the various cases available and came to the
conclusion, that although it was expensive, the Ortlieb case was
probably the best option. I bought mine from [[http://www.facewest.co.uk/Ortlieb-Map-Case.html][Facewest]].

When I unpacked the case I noticed how soft and flexible the material
felt. Several of the reviews I had read said how the case could easily
be rolled up, or even used as a seat, without creasing it. The roll
top closure system is very easy to use and has kept my maps dry. Now
that I have a map case, I wonder why I didn't buy one years ago. It's
not only useful for storing maps, but any other bits of paper that you might
want to refer to when walking, like bearings and distances. I have
also used it several times on cycle rides. On the bike if you sling it
over your shoulder it does tend to flap about a bit and get in the
way. However, it will attach to an Ortlieb bar bag. Oh no! Another bit
of kit to get.
