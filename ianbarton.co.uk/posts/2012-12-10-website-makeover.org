One of my original goals in using Jekyll as a static site generator
was to make it easier to write posts and thus increasing the
number of my posts. However, I found Jekyll had a couple of
idiosyncrasies with categorizing and tagging posts that made it
awkward for me to use. It was also difficult to re-theme the site,
without doing an almost ground up re-write.

I searched Google for another static site generator and tried a few
out before I discovered [[http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/][Pelican]] .This seemed to fit in with all my
requirements:

- written in Python, which makes it easier for me to hack on.
- good handling of categories, tags and static pages.
- easy to use [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][template]] language (Jinja2).
- themes
- it was simple to write a new reader that understood my existing
  YAML files, so I didn't have to rewrite all my old posts.
- I can use Emacs to write my posts.
