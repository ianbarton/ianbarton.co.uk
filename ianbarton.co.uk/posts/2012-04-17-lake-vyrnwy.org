Lake Vyrnwy is an ideal route for children. Although the road around
the lake is open to traffic, its winding nature and the presence of
many other cyclists keeps motorists speeds down. The total distance
around the lake is around 12 miles and the road is almost completely
flat.

There are several parking places around the lake, and a cafe near the
dam.

** A More Challenging Ride.
For those wanting a harder ride there is an absolutely fantastic ride
to Bala. It's usual to start the ride from Bala. There is around 600m
of ascent and the total length of the ride is about 35 miles. From
Bala the ride gains the col at Bwlch-y-Groes, which has fine views
over the Arans. At 1800ft this is the highest pass in Wales. You can
let your legs recover on the descent to the lake and have a well
earned piece of cake in the cafe near the dam. The way back to Bala
takes the other road from the end of the lake up through Cwm Hirnant
before descending back to Bala.
