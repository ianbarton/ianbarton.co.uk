I left <a href="http://www.chestnuts-whitehaven.com">Chestnuts</a> around 8:30am and cycled down into Whitehaven. I
cycled down to the harbour, but didn't bother going all the way along
to the C2C sign. The initial section out of Whitehaven is fairly grim. The
cycling is easy, but the route goes through several housing estates
and the path is littered with large collection of dog turds and broken
glass. Luckily this section isn't too long and I was soon following
the old railway line. The off road sections are almost all on tarmac
so fine on a road bike. There was a short section of rather bumpy
track just before Rowrah which would be unpleasant on a road bike if
it was very wet.
</p>

<p>
The weather, which had been fine for weeks looked decidedly dodgy. The
day before the tail end of a hurricane had passed through. The fells in
front were covered in cloud and there was a very strong wind. Luckily
the wind was blowing from the west, so was in fact a big help!
</p>

<p>
There is a stiff climb out of Kirkland, but the extra altitude gives
you great views over the surrounding countryside. There is a pleasant
downhill section to Lamplugh, with a stiff climb at the end. I was
headed towards Loweswater, but the view of the lake is obscured by
Burnbank. After a downhill section to Waterend I could finally see the
lake.  The road follows Loweswater, with some minor ups and downs
until you reach the village. I headed towards Brackenthwaite along a
narrow road with plenty of ups and downs. At the village of Low Lorton
there is a very steep section. Thankfully it's short and it deposits
you at the bottom of the Whinlatter Pass.
</p>

<p>
The climb up Whinlatter isn't to bad and there is a Visitor Centre at
the top, which I didn't bother visiting. I stopped i one of the car
parks to chew through an oat bar and have a drink. I realized how cold
and windy it was, as in about five minutes I went from an overheated
sweaty lump to a shivering lump! I can't really see the point of
following the forestry track, which looks steep and loose. The road is
fairly quiet. It is very steep in places, so you need to keep a check
on your speed and make sure that you can make it round the next bend,
without colliding with an oncoming car. At the bottom I crossed a
small suspension bridge over the Derwent. A short section along
a railway track emerged next to the A66. There is a good cycle track
alongside the road. It was on this track that I experienced the only
puncture of the trip. There was an explosive bang and the rear tyre
went flat instantly. I couldn't find anything that might have caused
this to happen and there was nothing stuck in the tyre. I had soon
fitted a new tube and continued the short distance into Keswick.
</p>

<p>
Keswick reminded me why I don't visit the Lakes anymore. It took about
five minutes before there was a break in the traffic, so I could cross
the road. The town itself was absolutely ram packed full of people
and almost every shop was some sort of outdoors emporium, with almost
no real shops.
</p>

<p>

<p>
I still had one spare tube, but I bought another at
<a href="http://www.keswickbikes.co.uk">KeswickBikes</a>. While I was there I bought a Cateye rear light, as my
son had commandeered mine for his bike. I wasn't expecting to be
riding in the dark, but having some sort of highly visible light in
case of heavy rain, or poor visibility is always a good idea. I
settled into the Saddleback cafe, which is next to Keswick Bikes. I
had a "proper" cheese and pickle doorstep wedge sandwich. While I was
eating it, the heavens opened and rain poured down. Fortunately, by
the time I had finished lunch the rain had blown over.
</p>

<p>
I made my way slowly through the centre of Keswick, which given the
amount of traffic was probably the most dangerous part of the
journey. I arrived at the bottom of the steep series of climbs up to
Castle Rigg Stone Circle. On one section I was going so slowly that I
was overtaken by a runner. Oh the shame and embarrassment! Finally I
made it to the stone circle, where I stopped for a rest. A few years
ago we had visited them with the children on a ride that went out of
Keswick along the old railway track and returned past the stone
circle.
</p>


<p>
I made a mistake shortly after the stone circle and turned left too
soon. This brought me out on the A66, with no option of avoiding
cycling along it. Fortunately I didn't have to cycle back too far to
get on the right route, which brought me out near Threlkeld. Past
Scales the road turns north on a narrow lane leading to
Mungrisdale. The lane had plenty of gates, so  every time I got into a
nice rhythm I had to get off to open and close a gate. Although
Mungrisdale is a pleasant enough place, it seems as if the C2C
deliberately chooses to meander about when a more direct route is
possible. I kept seeing signs on the A66 telling me that Penrith was
10 miles away, but I ended up cycling nearer 20! After another long
meander through Greystoke (home of Tarzan), it was finally time to
drop down into Penrith.
</p>

<p>
I made straight for Morrisons, where I had a large Bakewell tart and a
pot of tea. I received a text from my son, who is a lot fitter than me
and had arrived some time before. I was staying in the Travelodge on
the A66, where my wife was going to join me.  I was a bit worried how
I was going to get there, as I really didn't fancy cycling down the
A66. Luckily, there is a cycle path that leads alongside the A66
directly to the Travelodge.

<p>
The Travelodge had recently been refurbished and had decent size
rooms, pleasantly decorated. Travelodges can be cheap to stay in, but
recently seem to have been involved in a race to the bottom to cut facilities
and maintenance to the minimum to save costs. However, I would be
happy to stay in the Keswick one again! We had tea in the Little Chef
next door - I thought these were extinct.
</p>

<p>
I was happy with my performance on day one. I hadn't found the ride
hard and wasn't particularly tired.

<p>
Two of my three children were away, so Anne and I decided to take our
remaining daughter for a couple of days in North Wales. Neither of them like
camping, so we stayed in the bunk room at the <a href="http://www.bryntyrchinn.co.uk/">Bryn Tyrch</a> in Capel Curig.
</p>

<p>
We arrived late afternoon and since it looked as though it was going
to be a fine evening, so I decided to walk over Crimpiau. I did this walk
with my son three years ago the last time we stayed at the hotel.
However, I had forgotten to bring either my camera or phone, so wasn't
able to take any photographs. This time I made sure that I had both of
them with me!
</p>

<p>
Anne and Hannah wanted to go to Joe Browns in Capel Curig. I walked up
with them and then crossed the style to start up the path towards Llyn
Crafnant.  The last time I had done the walk the weather had been quite drizzly,
but today there were large patches of blue sky and broken cloud. It
was about 4:30pm and we had booked dinner at the hotel for 7:00pm. I
couldn't remember how long the walk had taken last time, but thought I
would be able to get back for seven. In the event this was a bit
optimistic and it was about 7:20pm! As anyone who has walked with me
can testify, I have never really planned how long a walk takes. My
stock answer is always "It will take as long as it takes". I just have
an overall plan of  what I want to do. On multi-day walks I just
continue until I find somewhere nice to camp, I am too tired or it
goes dark.
</p>

<p>
It seemed a long way to the col above Llyn Crafnant. It's not possible
to see the lake from the col, so I carried on to a high point on a
small spur that overlooked part of the lake. There were good views over
to Creigiau Gleision. The last time I had climbed it was about 30 years
ago in driving rain. I can remember it had lots of false tops and was
boggy and heathery. I keep meaning to go back and climb it in good
weather, but somehow have always been distracted by its nearby neighbours.
</p>

<p>
I returned to the col and began the climb up Crimpiau. It's not
possible to tell exactly where on the ridge the summit is from
below, so I just followed the most obvious path hoping it would get me
there. It seemed a long way before  a final short steep pull landed me
next to some rocks. These seemed to be the highest point on the ridge,
although unlike most other Snowdonia peaks there was no cairn.  From
the top there were views along the Ogwen valley, over Capel Curig to
Snowdon and to Cader Idris in the south. As is often the case the
views from the smaller peaks are often better than from the high ones.
</p>

<p>
I dropped down from the summit and followed the ridge all the way down
to the small Llyn Coren. It is normally very boggy here. I remember
going past it with John on my last visit and following a path that
kept to the rocks above the boggy part. Luckily for me, it was
dry today. I had a bit of trouble finding the path beyond the lake
that descends back to Capel, but found it eventually without having
to consult the map.

<p>
At the bottom of the descent, I missed the short cut that goes
directly down to the Bryn Tyrch, which I had taken with John last
time and ended up back outside the cafe in Capel Curig. A final trot
down the road into the bar, where a drink was waiting for me and I was
only 20 minutes late.

<p>
I had been lucky with the weather. The next day it poured down all
day. Anne and Hannah went to visit <a href="http://www.llechwedd-slate-caverns.co.uk/Zipworld_Page.php">Bounce Below</a> in the Llechwedd Slate
mines at Ffestiniog. As someone who hates "attractions", theme parks
and queuing for anything I wandered around the old slate workings near
Tanygrisiau.

<p>
I was going to visit a relative in Swansea and thought I could combine
the journey with an overnighter on Glasgwm.
</p>

<p>
I had forgotten what a long haul it is from home to Dinas
Mawddwy.  I got to the small car park at the end of Cwm Cywarch about
5:30pm. Although the car park was nowhere near full, there were more
cars than I had seen on my previous visits. Various people were
returning from their day out and getting ready to depart for home. The
weather forecast was for a clear night, so I wanted to try some
astrophotography from the summit. A couple of years ago I bought a
Yongnuo  <a href="http://www.linearconcepts.com/photography/reviews/photo1">MC-36B</a>  intervalometer for my Canon DSLR. I have used it at home to
create time lapse photos and take astro pictures. I have an Velbon
tripod that belonged to my father, which I intended to lug up to the summit. I
finished packing my rucksack and strapped the tripod to
the outside.
</p>

<p>
I set off along the track and ended up outside the Bryn Hafod hut. There were
a couple of people sitting outside and I asked if the track behind the
hut continued up to the col above. They didn't know and I don't remember
passing the hut on my previous visits, so I guessed I had missed the
start of the path. I continued along a feint path behind the hut for
some way until it became obvious that I was way off route. I returned
back to the track where the the style I should have climbed over was now obvious!

<p>
It was very hot with hardly a cloud in the sky. Luckily after a few
hundred feet most of the steep section of the route was in shade. I
plodded up the path towards the col. Some way below it I came out of
the shade. The sun was now low in the sky and shining almost directly in
my face. Even wearing sun glasses it was difficult to see where I was
going. I finally emerged at the col below Glasgwm drenched with
sweat.
</p>

<p>
The way to the summit was straightforward, albeit a bit of a slog. It
was just a matter of following the fence which leads to within a few
yards of the summit cairn. There were fine views to the West with very
little heat haze. I could see the summit of Arenig Fawr, where I had
been a couple of weeks ago, although Moel Llyfnant, where I had camped
was hidden from sight. A final steep rise bought the summit cairn into
view. Llyn Bach just below the summit was almost dry. I continued past
the summit and climbed the stile at the end of Llyn y Fign. The llyn
is in a magnificient position with good views in almost every
direction. Even better for summit campers there was no need to carry
up a heavy load of water. I made my way to the flat grassy area just
to the north of the lake, where I had camped previously. There was a
pleasant westerly breeze which soon evaporated all the sweat.

<p>
I soon had the tent pitched and there was still a couple of hours until
sunset at around 8:45pm, I made a cup of hot chocolate and had some
porridge and raisins. When I had finished eating,  I grabbed the camera and began walking around
the summit plateau. Looking towards Cader I could see it would be
possible to take
a high level route and continue over its summit to Dolgelleau. A
future backpack. Over to
the South West I could see the wind turbines on ???.  As the sun sank
towards the horizon a layer of cloud formed, so I didn't get the
spectacular sunset that I saw last time. The top of Aran
Fawddwy glowed pink as did the summit cairn of Glasgwm, as the sun
sank below the clouds.

<p>
At this time of year it takes a long time for it to get really dark
after the sun has set, so I got into my sleeping bag for a couple of
hours to wait for the stars to appear. I woke up about 12:30am to see
a clear sky outside. The stars of the plough were clearly visible over
the top of my tent. I put the camera on the tripod and started taking
some photographs. However, my attempt was thwarted by condensation
forming on the lens. Not even leaving the camera for outside some time
to adjust to the temperature outside the tent made any
difference. Eventually I called it a night and went back to my
sleeping bag. I woke again at 5:30am and made breakfast - porridge
again! I got out of the tent and began to take photographs. However,
soon a layer of early morning cloud obscured the summit. I packed up
and began the descent back to the car. I dropped out of the mist some
way above the col, but most of the surrounding summits were misted
out. I had badly bruised my left big toe on my Carneddau trip a few
weeks ago, so the descent was quite slow. Although th toe had stopped
hurting, the nail had turned black and I didn't want to aggravate the
injury.
</p>


<p>
Back at the car park a couple of cars had arrived and people were
departing for their walk. I threw my rucksack into the back of the
truck and got ready to resume my journey to Swansea.  I drove back
along the Cwm following the farmer with his sheep trailer. The road is
very narrow with few passing places, so it was good to have an
oncoming traffic detector in front of me!

<p>
I have done this backpack a couple of times before. However, I had no
hesitation in repeating it. The Arenigs are relatively unfrequented
and have panoramic views over most of the mountains of North
Wales. The summit of Moel Llyfnant seems to be rarely visited, as there
are only vague signs of tracks leading up to the top.
</p>


<p>
After a long period of settled good weather the Mountain Weather Information
Service was predicting an area of low pressure over Wales on Saturday
with a great deal of uncertainty about conditions. The summits were
going to be misted out early on and there was a possibility of heavy
showers. However, the forecast for Sunday was much better.
</p>

<p>
Driving along the A55,  I could see see clouds over the Carneddau, but it wasn't
raining. I stopped at Y Caban in Deniolen for a cup of tea and lemon
drizzle cake. It took the woman behindthe counter about five munutes
to ask me what I wanted to order, as she was looking at photos on here
phone, even though I was only standing a couple of feet away from
her. I ended up buying a slice of Bakewell to take my bill over £5, so
I could avoid a surcharge for paying by debit card.
</p>

<p>
As I drove thought the Llanberis Pass, only the tops of the peaks
were covered by cloud. Continuing through Beddgelert I could see that
the summit of Cnicht was clear.  However, as I got close to Ffestiniog, I could see the
Moelwyns submerged in cloud and this part of Wales seemed to be having
much worse weather than further west. However, I decided to keep going
as MWIS had promised an improvement in the weather as the day went on.

<p>
It was after 12:30pm when I arrived in the car park opposite the
quarry at Clogwyn Maen Glogog. I could see the summit of Arenig Fach,
but mist was drifting around the top of Arenig Fawr. The quarry was
full of large concrete road sections. The electricity company were
rewiring the overhead pylons that run through the valley and using the
car park as an equipment dump. I sorted out my gear and set off on the
longish walk along the road towards the track leading up to Llyn
Arenig Fawr. Leaving the car opposite the quarry would greatly reduce
the road walking on the second day.

<p>
When I reached the start of the track there was a large red sign at
the bottom saying it was closed. However, there was no work going on,
so I decided to ignore the sign. A short way up the track I could see
why it has been closed. The cables between the pylons ran right over
the track, which would be a major hazard for anyone underneath when
they were working on the pylons. Since it was Saturday there was no work going
on, although all around the valley I could see where they had laid the temporary
road surfaces under the pylons.

<p>
When I reached the bothy I took off my rucksack and had a look round
inside. It was clean and tidy. Written on an old biscuit tin lid was
the email address (arenigtony@gmail.com) of one of the people who
helps to maintain the bothy. I sat on one of the benches outside and
ate the huge slice of Bakewell that I had bought from Y Caban. After
lunch I walked the short distance up to the reservoir to fill my
Travel Tap.
</p>

<p>
The mist was partially covering the crags at the far end of the lake
as I began to make my way up the path. At the top of the first steep
section I met a man descending who told me that the summit was misted
out and there was a cold breeze. Last time I had climbed directly up
on the North ridge to get better views. However, this time there wasn't any
point, as I wouldn't be able to see anything. I just followed the main path
that countours along the slope below the ridge before a final slog up to the summit.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Mist filled valleys at dawn</b></p>

<p>
The mist cleared a few times, but had descended again just before I
reached the summit. Just below the summit shelter I met a man and a
woman descending. Not surprisingly there wasn't anybody else on the
summit. The mist again cleared briefly but after a few seconds the
summit was covered again. After a short rest, I took a compass bearing
to make sure that I would be descending along the South ridge. Once
I had begun to descend below the south summit I dropped out of the
cloud. I could just about make out Moel Llyfnant on the other side of
the valley as layers of cloud drifted past, but the lakes at the end of the south ridge were clearly visible
below me. I made my way down the grass slope, using the fence as a
hand rail and along to the second
pool. I dropped my rucksack a short distance away from the pool and took my Platypus
bottles over to the pool. I had a bit of trouble finding a place on
the bank where I could reach into the pool without disturbing the peat
on the bottom. On my first visit, I had collected water from a small
stream at the start of the descent to the col below Moel
Llyfnant. However, last time I came this way the stream was dry and I suspected
it might be dry today. In the event I was proved right.
</p>

<p>

<p class="caption"><b>Tent on Moel Llyfnant</b></p>

float-left" alt="Tent on Moel Llyfnant"><img src="galleries/2014-07-arenigs/IMG_8497.JPG"></a></b>


<p>
I used the pile of stones placed next to the wire fence that marks the
start of the descent to the col below Moel Llyfnant. There is an
indistinct path that leads down to the track at the col, whcih I
followed. The section at the bottom is often very wet, but after the
recent dry spell my feet only got slightly damp as I tussock
jumped. The mist seemed to be lifting. The summit of Moel Llyfnant was
clear and the summit of Arenig Fawr kept popping out of its covering.
</p>

<p>
The climb up to Moel Lyfnant via its East flank is steep and
unremitting. There are traces of a track in places, but I find it's
best just to take a direct line to the summit rocks. I emerged at the
top almost exactly at 6:00pm. There was a stiff breeze blowing from
the East. My usual camping spot between some rocks was quite exposed
to the breeze, so I dropped down to another flat spot a few yards to
the west, which was more sheltered. I soon had the tent up and after a
quick cup of hot chocolate I went on a short wander to take some
photographs.
</p>

<p>
I was hungry, so when I got back to the tent I heated some water and
had one of the Adventure Foods expedition breakfasts. This was OK, but
definitely not as good as the Bewell Foods Hot Cereal Start. I felt
quite tired so settled into my sleeping bag. About 6:30pm the mist
descended over the summit and all views were obscured.
</p>

<p>
I turned on my phone,  hoping to send some photographs home. There was excellent
reception, but it was on a different network to mine (Three).  On my
previous two visits I had been using T-Mobile, which has solid 3g
coverage o the summit.
</p>

<p>
I got up sometime around midnight to find that the cloud had lifted
above the summit and I could see the lights of all the surrounding
towns. The next time I woke it was 5:30am and daylight. Looking out of
the tent I could see it was still clear, so I got out for a look
round. There was quite a bit of thick cloud higher up, particularly
around the Arans. A couple of the valleys had a covering of early
morning mist. The sun was hidden behind a bank of cloud, so there
wasn't a spectacular sunrise. I made a cup of hot chocolate and
porridge and then went back to bed. I got up again about 6:15 am to
take some more photographs and pack up.
</p>

<p>

<p>
I planned to go over to Foel Boeth and Moel y Slates having been here
twice without climbing them. However, as I was packing the tent away
about 7:00am the mist descended again. I could see glimpses of the sun
above it, so hoped it might clear. It wasn't to be and if anything it
got thicker. I decide that walking over Foel Boeth would be a waste of
time if I couldn't see anything. It looked a pretty uninspiring hill
even in clear visibility. I set off down the North ridge following a
compass bearing, as there is no clear path, but numerous sheep tracks
which wander off in various ransom directions giving you the illusion
that you are following a path. I was quite a way down the ridge before
I emerged from the cloud. My big toe on my left foot was hurting. I
had bruised it on my Carneddeau trip and now it felt as though the
nail was coming off. I scrambled down the last bit of the ridge to
join the farm track.
</p>

<p>
I decided to follow the track from Amnodd-bwll that lead towards the
railway track, rather the one that takes the higher ground and goes
past Amnodd-wen. This latter track has a section which is sunken next
to a dry stone wall. On both my previous visits I have got very wet
feet as there is no real way of avoiding the boggy section. The track
that leads to the railway initially goes through the forest, thus has
restricted views. Once out of the forest the views are just as good as
those from the higher track. I reached the railway track and started
to follow it. It doesn't seem to get much
traffic and some sections were covered by long grass. I met a couple of cows with
calves on the track, but shooed them up onto the hillside, so I
wouldn't have to walk to close to them. The railway track emerged onto
the road. This final section along the road back to the quarry
seems much longer than it actually is. Once back at the truck I had
another cup of hot chocolate.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I was walking back along the railway track the summits had all
cleared. I did consider doing another walk to take advantage of the
clear conditions. Unfortunately, I had to drive back through Chester
to pick up my daughter in the early afternoon, which didn't leave
enough time.
</p>

<p>
Although the weather had been much better on my last two trips to the
Arenigs, it hadn't been too bad this time.  I hadn't seen the
spectacular sunsets and sunrises of my previous two trips, but the
mist filled valleys at dawn compensated. Plus I always enjoy a summit
camp away from everyone else.

<p>
I had wanted to get out backpacking all year, but my free time had
always coincided with periods of poor weather. Finally I could get out
for a couple of days and the forecast was good. The plan was to drive
into Cwm Eigiau and do a two day traverse. I had done a similar route
a couple of years ago, but wanted to do a similar route in reverse
starting at Pen Llithrig y Wrach and going clockwise around the ridge.
</p>


<p>
Last year various bits of the road into Cwm Egiau were widened and new
passing places installed and the road was closed for several
months. Before these improvements there were only a very limited
number of places where passing was possible, so meeting a mini bus
coming in the opposite direction usually involved a fair bit of
reversing. This wasn't much fun as there are several hair pin bends
and some 20% gradients. As luck would have it, I met a large mini bus coming
down just next to the first gate. I had to bump up onto the grass pull
in next to the gate to let it past. At the second gate I passed
someone walking up the road and he kindly to closed the gate for me.
</p>

<p>
The weather forecast was for early morning mist over the summits to
clear by midday. However, at 10:30am the summits were all misted out
and I wondered if I had made the right choice in coming up into Cwm
Eigiau.
</p>

<p>
There were only a couple of cars parked in the car park. While I was
getting ready the man who had opened the gate stopped to chat with
me. He was originally from Dolgarrog, but was now living in
Manchester. He had camped further down the road and was going to walk
over to Llyn Colwyd before going back to Dolgarrog.

<p>
I bumped into him again when I went up to the reservoir to fill my
water bottles. He asked if he could walk with me up towards Pen
Llithrig yr Wrach. We set off along a track that leads up to an old
quarry on the slopes of Pen Llithrig yr Wrach. I hadn't been this way
before and there are some impressive holes in the ground, which I
presume are old mine entrances. Part of the way along the track I
realised that I had left my stove in the car. My walking companion
very kindly offered to let me borrow his, but I said that I would
manage OK. When we got to the ridge he turned off to descend towards
Llyn Colwyd. I plodded on up the summit of Pen y Llithrig y Wrach,
which was still covered in mist. Luckily the mist cleared just as I
reached the summit and I was able to enjoy good views while I sat and
ate my sandwich and chocolate brownie.

<p>
I still hadn't decided what to do about the missing stove. All my
camping food was dehydrated, so without hot water I wasn't going to be
able to eat until I got back to the car. I had my Travel Tap, so I
could top up my water supplies from the various pools of water.  At
first I thought I might be able to gather enough old heather roots to
make a fire. However, there was very little old heather about and most
of it was damp.  Eventually, I decided to press on and see how I felt
later in the day. The slope up to Pen yr Helgi Du seemed harder than
the last time I did it. I stopped a couple of times on the way to the
summit.   As I descended to Bwlch Eryl
Farchog I got cramp in my legs, probably because I wasn't drinking enough water.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the brief scramble up to the summit of Craig yr
Ysfa. However, the long ridge leading up to Carnedd Llelwlyn was very slow
going . If I had got the stove with me, I would probably camped at
the spot Ella and I used in ??? at the foot of the final ridge, even thought it was still early
afternoon. In retrospect I should have brought more water and some
carbohydrate snacks with me. Eventually I arrived at the summit, which was covered in mist
despite being clear a few minutes earlier. Luckily, the mist cleared just long
enough for me to take a photo of Moel Siabod.

<p>
 I thought I might camp next to the small pools of water on
Gledrffordd. At least I would have water and wouldn't be too far from
the car the next morning. I glimpsed the pools through brief clearings
in the mist. However, I wasn't at all certain how to get down to them
and the detail of that area on my Harveys BMC map didn't really give
me any clues. I was pretty certain it was a straightforward slope, but
didn't really know where I needed to turn off the main ridge and it
there would be any crags that weren't marked on my map. I set off in
the direction of Foel Goch, finding the bouldery initial section hard
going. I checked the GPS a couple of times to fix my position on the
map. It was still very misty and I couldn't see the descent to
Gledrffordd. As I lost a bit of height the mist cleared and I could
see the path clearly in front of me. I descended from the crest of the
ridge towards the path and in the distance I could see the pools of
water on Gledrffordd. I didn't feel too bad going downhill, but still
got a few attacks of cramp. I didn't have a lot of water left and
wanted to conserve it in case I couldn't find a stream.

<p>
As I made may way towards Gledrffordd, I began to think it might be
more sensible to descend all the way back to the car, as I was feeling
very hungry. The prospect of lying awake all night thinking I could
eat if I continued the relatively short distance back to the car
wasn't appealing. It seemed a long way to over the grassy plateau to
the pools on Gledrffordd, but eventually I reached the rocky crest at
the end. The path disappeared into the rocks and thinking that I was
at the end of the ridge , I clambered over the rocky crest and began
to descend. I should have checked the map first!

The valley below was obscured by mist, but this cleared after I had
descended a couple of hundred feet. I could see that I was on the
crags (Craig Eigiau) about half way along Llyn Eigiau. Trying to
descend these was not a good idea, as the ground was steep and rocky!
Painfully I regained the crest of the ridge and began traversing along
the slope below and parallel to it. Finally, the path
descended towards a Landrover track. I was very tired and hobbled
along the track eventually, rejoining the road next to the car
park. All the way down I had passed no streams and only a few muddy
pools on Gledrffordd. I would have expected more water after the recent rains.

<p>
Luckily there was a bottle of water inside the truck, which I drank
before retrieving the stove and staggering off towards the
reservoir. I did think of camping at Maeneira, which from other
people's reports looked an ideal spot.  However, it wasn't marked on
my Harvey map and I wasn't sure exactly where it was. I went through
the smaller of the two gaps in the dam and splashed though a boggy
area before finding somewhere drier on slightly raised ground. I
chucked down my rucksack and went over to the reservoir to fill my
water bottles. There were several Cuckoos calling as I put the tent
up.  It was well after 10:00pm before I had the tent up and my gear
stowed inside. I made a mug of hot chocolate and had a hot cereal
start to eat. Finally, before getting into my sleeping bag I drank
another cup of hot chocolate.
</p>

<p>
A short while later it got very light. Looking outside I could see
there was a full moon. The mist over the summits from earlier had
disappeared and there was a clear starry sky.

<p>
I woke up about 5:30am, with the sun already rising. I crawled out of
the tent and put on some water to boil for a cup of hot chocolate and
to make some porridge. I was expecting to get cramp in my legs, but apart from
feeling very sore they were OK. After eating breakfast I got out the
Tyvek sheet from my rucksack and piled all the stuff from the tent on
top of it to stop it getting wet. I took my time packing away and
enjoyed looking at the scenery.

<p>
In order to avoid the boggy section, I walked up to the big break in
the dam wall before rejoining the Landrover track. It seemed a long
way back to the truck and the sun was already getting hot. I was
wearing my new Montane insulated trousers which I had brought along
for camp use, as my Mammut Base Jumps were wet from yesterday. Once
back at the truck I changed into my lightweight Rab Treklites and felt
much better.

<p>
I drove into Caernarfon and joined the A55 driving towards Bangor. I
stopped at Y Caban in Deniolen. It was only 8:50am and they didn't
open until 9:00am, so I sat on the seats outside, enjoying the
sunshine. They were having a veggie week, so my sausage sandwich was
vegetarian. I am not a vegetarian, but do enjoy veggie food. However,
I was wondering what the sausage would taste like.  I needn't have
worried as it tasted as good as the meat version. Y Caban is very
friendly and serves excellent food, highly recommended. I had a couple
of cups of coffee before setting off for Capel Curig.

<p>
Just outside Joe Browns in Capel Curig I bumped into some old friends
from Sheffield and we had a chat.  They had been up Cnicht the day
before and were thinking of a Carneddau trip today.
</p>

<p>
Even though I hadn't managed to camp on a summit, it had been a
worthwhile trip and I enjoyed camping next to the reservoir. The cloud
had persisted longer than forecast, but had cleared often enough to
give me good views. Next time I'll double check to make sure I haven't
left my stove in the truck!

This review is all about a trio of Montane Prisms!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5512798" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5512798">Prism Jacket.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5512798">
<p>
The Prism jacket has been around for a while and is now at
version 2. The outer is Pertex microlight and it's filled with 40g of
Primaloft. For those of you that don't know Primaloft is best
described as artificial down. Weight for weight down will keep you
warmer than Primaloft. However, Primaloft doesn't clump when it gets
wet unlike down, which then loses most of its insulating
properties. Hence Primaloft is usually more suitable for the British
climate, where it's more often damp and cold unlike the cold dry
weather in an Alpine environment.
</p>

<p>
So what sort of British conditions is the jacket useful for? It's not
really a full on Scottish winter belay jacket, although you could use
it under a hard shell. It's more of a three season cold/windy
jacket. The Pertex outer is water resistant and will keep out
persistent drizzle, but not a full on downpour. However, if it does
get completely soaked it dries out quickly. Even in summer it's useful
as something to wear at rest stops or at night when camping. My size L
only weighs 445g, so it's not too heavy if you are carrying it in your
rucsack most of the time. It will pack into its own pocket, taking
up very little space in your rucksack.
</p>

<p>
I am 6ft 2" with a 38" chest. The large size fits me with some room to
spare inside and it's long enough to cover my body. I often find that
medium sized jackets fit me, but aren't long enough. The Prism has a
slight drop tail, so will help stop the small of you back getting cold.
</p>

<p>
On to the details. The pockets are padded with Primaloft, which makes
them good for hand warming. They are positioned fairly high up, so are
accessible if you are wearing a waist strap or climbing harness. The
cuffs are elasticated keeping out the wind and moisture. There is some
soft material inside the zip flap at the head end. This acts as a
beard guard and even if you don't have a beard will stop your neck and
lips chafing against the material. The full sized hood has a good
volume adjuster, which makes it a comfortable fit with or without a
helmet. I am not always a fan of hoods, often preferring a hat, but I
like this hood.
</p>

<p>
In use I have found the jacket both warm and very breathable. I have used it
for cycling in temperatures between freezing and about 6C over a
lightweight Merino top. I didn't overheat or find sweat building up
inside the jacket.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1361d30" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1361d30">Prism Gilet.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1361d30">
<p>
I have got a couple of other gilets. A Marmot Driclime, which is
excellent for warmer weather and a Paramo Torres. I wear the Torres
almost every day at home between Autumn and Summer. It's very and very
robust. However, it's not particularly light (???g) and doesn't pack
down very small. Thus it's good if you actually wear it all day, but
not so good if you are carrying it in your rucksack.
</p>

<p>
Recently I picked up a Montane Prism gilet. Like the jacket this is
filled with Primaloft and the pockets are also Primaloft filled. Also
like the jacket it packs away in its own pocket. I can see myself
using the gilet a lot from Spring to Autumn worn over a base layer and
with my Rab Vapour Rise Lite jacket. Combined with my Montane Lite
Speed jacket as an outer layer, these three layers should keep me
comfortable in most conditions.

<div id="outline-container-orgbae0e43" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbae0e43">Prism Trousers.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbae0e43">
<p>
After a long walk carrying a rucksack when I finally set up camp I
find that if my legs get cold I end up with bad attacks of cramp. I
usually sleep in some thin long johns, to help keep my sleeping bag
clean, but if I am just lounging around inside the tent these aren't
warm enough.
</p>

<p>
I have been looking around for something warmer than long johns, that
don't weigh much and could also be used to boost my sleeping bag's
insulation in winter. Montane's Prism Pants seemed to a good
choice. Initially, I had reservations. I have got a pair of Montane
Terra trousers, which even in the large size are way too short for my
legs. For some reason Montane seem to make their trousers shorter than
other manufacturers. However,  I needn't have worried as they were
long enough. They pack down into a small stuff sack an my size L weigh
318g. There are short zips at the bottom of the legs and a number of
press stud fastenings,which let you cinch up the bottoms.
</p>

<p>
There are no pockets or fly zip. However, for my intended use this
isn't a problem. The Rab photon trousers have full length zips, a fly
zip, more Primaloft and have pockets.  There are also reinforced seat,
knees and kick patches. However, they are considerably
heavier at 550g for the L size. Most of the additional features are
only of use if you intend to wear them all day an while the extra
Primaloft makes them warmer, the Prisms should be warm enough for me.

A New Year and time for some changes. This blog has got something of
a mixture of technology related posts and posts about the outdoors. I
have decided to start a new blog at <a href="http://ianbarton.net">http://ianbarton.net</a> to which is
going to be about technology. This blog will be where I post all my
outdoors related content. I have started by moving all the technology
related posts from this blog over to the new one.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of gear related reviews, which are scattered around. I
am planning to make an index page to make it easier to find a
review. I'll also be adding an index page for my backpacking posts and
I hope to add a gpx file and map for each post.
