</p>

<p>
For some time I had wanted to do a two day backpack around the Arans,
starting from Cwm Cyarch and climbing Aran Fawddwy, then
making my way along the duck boards and climbing Glasgwm to camp near
Llyn y Fign.
</p>

<p>
After a spell of settled weather the rain had arrived. However, the
<a href="http://mwis.org.uk">MWIS</a> site was predicting decent weather over Snowdonia. I left home
shortly after 7:00am in a steady drizzle and headed towards
Welshpool. As I started heading up the Tanat Valley, I could see the
hills on either side covered in cloud, while the rain didn't show any
signs of stopping. I decided to carry on driving through Cwm Hirnant
to Bala. This would give me the option of continuing onto Capel Curig
if the weather was still bad, or ascend the Arans from the Bala
side. As I dropped down towards Bala, the weather was less awful, but
both the Arans and Arenigs were submerged in cloud, so I continued
onto the A5 towards Capel Curig.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived in Capel Curig, the weather was much better and most of
the tops were clear of cloud. I parked in the small car park behind
Joe Brown's shop and studied the map. I needed to be back home early
on the next morning, so wanted an overnight camp on a summit not too
far from the car. I had already camped on the Carnedds twice this
year, so planned a route over Glyders. I decided to leave the car
where it was and walk along the old A5 towards Ogwen, then traverse
the summits back to my starting point.
</p>

<p>
I have done day walks from Ogwen over the Glyders to Capel Curig
several times, but never camped overnight on the summits. My plan was
to scramble up the Gribin Ridge, traverse Glyder Fach and then camp
somewhere near Llyn Caseg y Fraith. However, it was already 10:30am
and it would be completely dark around 6:00pm. Also, I was carrying a
load so the plan might be too ambitious.
</p>

<p>
I set off along the old A5 towards Ogwen enjoying the views from the
track. When I got to the foot of Tryfan it was obvious that I didn't
have time to complete my original route. I decided on a scramble up
Tryfan, followed by Bristly Ridge if I had time. I have never climbed
the West face all the way to the summit and have done the North Ridge
loads of times in the past. So I decided to try and make up a
scrambling route up the West face. I didn't have either my scambles guide or
the climbing guide, but didn't anticipate any insurmountable problems.
</p>

<p>
I climbed up towards the far end of Milestone Buttress where I started
up Pulpit Route, which is an easy rock climb on big holds. The rock
seemed very greasy, which is unusual for Tryfan, as the rock on the
popular routes is very clean. I avoided Ivy Chimney, which would have
proved problematic with a big sack and continued up what is the normal
descent gully from the top of Milestone. Near the top there were a
series of rocky steps, which didn't look too hard. People had
obviously been this way before and it didn't look too far to easier
ground above. However, the rock was like soap bars and the climbing
felt very insecure. About 60 feet above the scree was a short
wall. This didn't appear too hard, but all the holds were outward
sloping. The wall was situated above a decent size ledge, so I wasn't
too worried about trying to climb it. About ten feet above the ledge I
had to make a high step onto a big sloping hold. As I was pushing up
on the hold my foot skated off and I started to fall. I flattened
myself against the rock, so there would be less chance of me bouncing
off the ledge, as that would send me down the 60ft drop into the gully
below. Unfortunately, as I slithered down my left foot caught on a
nubbin of rock and got bent right up. There was a sharp pain in my
calf muscle and I dropped in a heap on the ledge.
</p>

<p>
I got myself into a sitting position and moved my foot
gingerly. Luckily, I hadn't done any serious damage. I considered
going down, but reversing the slippery rock below me while carrying a
heavy pack didn't appeal. I could see a traverse line to the left,
which lead to a quartzite band, which didn't look hard. However, the
section above this was hidden from view round a corner. It appeared as
though I was only a short distance from where the steep ground merged
into the North ridge, so I decided to go and have a look. I teetered
across the grassy traverse onto a ledge. Gaining the quartz band, I
could see that there weren't any serious difficulties above it.
Finally I emerged onto the crest of the buttress, where I met an
Irishman trying to descend. I told him that I didn't think that it was
a good idea, but he seemed to try anyway. Later on, making my way up
towards the North Ridge, I was pleased to see that he had abandoned
his attempt and was climbing back up.

  &lt;p&gt;Y Garn from Tryfan&lt;/p&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>


<p>
By this time the clag had descended and the rest of the ridge was
misted out. The rock on Tryfan, especially on the popular routes, is
very clean and not normally slippy when wet. However, today the whole
mountain was like a skating rink and it wasn't just me who was
slipping and sliding. I stopped on the summit for a few minutes where
I took a group photo for three men.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to continue up Bristly Ridge. However, it was now mid
afternoon and given the slimy rock on the North Ridge, plus my heavy
sack. I decided to change my plans yet again. I descended the steep
screen slope from Bwlch Tryfan into Cwm Tryfan. There was plentiful
water supplies down there and I thought I might set up camp in the
Cwm. It was shortly after 4:00pm by the time I reached the stream and
I was now below the clag. Looking up I decided that I had just about
enough time to climb up the track to the col and camp somewhere near
Llyn Caseg y Fraith. I filled my water bottles and after a short rest,
I plodded slowly upwards, reaching the col around 5:00pm. I was now
back in the clag and given the poor visibility and rapid approach of
darkness decided to set up the tent a couple of hundred yards from the
edge.
</p>

<p>
I had just managed to get the tent set up and all my stuff inside when
it started to rain. The rain blown by a strong gusty wind continued
for several hours. After it had stopped I unzipped the tent door and
looking outside I could see the sky was almost completely clear. The
wind was gradually dropping and I had a peaceful night.

<p>
One disadvantage of camping at the end of October is it's dark for
about 12 hours. I cooked and listened to a couple of podcasts on my
phone before drifting off to sleep. As there was almost no wind, I
slept quite well, waking around 6:00am. Sunrise was shortly after
8:00am and it doesn't really get light enough to do much before
7:00am, so I spent an hour making drinks and eating breakfast.

<p>
The weather was perfect. There was only some high cirrus and a slight
breeze. I was ready to go shortly before 8:00am. I was walking almost
due East, so had perfect views of the rising sun. I was a bit
concerned about how my leg would be. Luckily, apart from some muscle
pain my leg was fine. The main summits of the Glyders are justifiably
very popular. However, it's unusual to see anyone on the section
between Glyder Fach and Capel Curig.

<p>
There is a small rock outcrop near to the lake, which provides a great
viewpoint over the east face of Tryfan. Readers of Poucher's guide
will recognise this as the site of the photo on the frontispiece.  I
made my way past Llyn Caseg y Fraith and up to the summit of Y Foel
Goch.  For many years this was known as the "Nameless Peak" (see
Poucher's Guide). It wasn't given a name on the OS maps, but in recent
years the OS have shown it as Y Foel Goch. The summit is a great view
point, for both the Glyders and the Carnedds. After spending a few
minutes taking photographs, I made my way over towards Galtt yr
Ogof. It's possible to bypass this summit, but it's well worth the
short detour for the excellent views.

<p>
Leaving the summit of Galtt yr OgofI, I began the long descent towards
Cefyn y Capel. This is a long flat ridge which ends above Capel
Curig. There are good views of the Snowdon Horseshoe and directly in
front of you Moel Siabod. This section is usually boggy, but after the
long dry summer I had expected it to be fairly dry. However, there
must have been some heavy rain in Snowdonia recently, as it was indeed
very boggy. My old Hi Trek boots are distinctly non waterproof and my
feet were soon very damp. I was glad that I hadn't decided to wear
trail shoes.

<p>
There are a number of paths you could follow, but essentially you just
follow the crest of the ridge to its end. Finally the path drops down
and emerges just behind the farm next to the track leading to the car
park. I hadn't met a single person all morning, until I got back to
the car park.
</p>

<p>
After getting out of my wet boots and socks, I drove round to Pete's
Eats for a fry up.

After another summer of indifferent weather, following the hot spring,
the Snowdonia weather forecast was predicting a couple of days of
cloud free summits. Not deterred by our very windy camp on the summit
of Moel Siabod, Ella was keen to go on another summit camp.

</p>

<p>
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

</div>



<p>
The plan was to climb Carnedd Llewelyn via the road up to Fyffon
Lllugwy and traversing Craig yr Ysfa, camping on or near to the
summit. On day two we would traverse the ridge to Pen yr Ole Wen and
descend the South East ridge back to the valley.

<p>
We arrived at Capel Curig at lunch time and went into the Pinnacle
Cafe to eat and fortify ourselves for the haul up to the
summit. Driving round towards Ogwen after lunch it was apparent that
the MWIS forecast was wrong, as the main Carneddeau ridge was covered
in cloud. Hoping that the tops would clear later on and that the
forecast for clear tops tomorrow would be correct, we decided to
proceed with our plan.

I had planned to leave the car at one of the two camp sites in the
valley, as I was a bit concerned that leaving the car on the A5
overnight might lead to the mountain rescue being called out. However,
whilst both camp sites are happy for you to park your car there during
the day, for a small fee, neither of them will allow overnight parking
unless you are camping there. So, I ended up leaving the car on the
hard shoulder just down the road from Gwern y Gof Uchaf, which
was almost opposite to the path down from the SE ridge of Pen yr Ole
Wen.
</p>

<p>
I packed almost all the gear into my POD Black Ice, leaving Ella to
carry just her sleeping bag and the two camping mats in my Osprey
Talon 33. The Osprey was miles too big for her, but she insisted on
using it and since she was carrying very little weight I thought she
would be OK.
</p>


<p>
We set off back along the old A5 and emerged almost opposite the start
of the road up to Fyffon Llugwy. This is quite a steep sloge and I am
sure that the road has got longer since the last time I walked up it!
However, the tedium was relieved by watching a wild pony and its foal
near to the track. When we arrived at the reservoir the cloud had
descended even further and was just brushing Bwlch Eryl Farchog. As
there is no water up on the summit plateau, I filled up our three one
litre Platypus bottles from the reservoir.
</p>

<p>
After a short rest, we made our way back to the path that leads up
towards Bwlch Eryl Farchog. I remember this path as being very eroded
the last time I cam this way, which was probably in the early
1990's. However, it looks as though quite a bit of work has been done
on the lower section and it's only the steep final section which is
unpleasant to climb. Ella seemed tired, so when I reached Bwlch Eryl
Farchog I dumped my rucksack and descended about half way to carry her
sack for her.
</p>

<p>
From the col we set out to scramble up Craig yr Ysfa. A runner with a
dog passed us. When he reached the short scrambling section the dog
decided it didn't want to climb and had to be manhandled up the short
rocky step. We were now surrounded by swirling mist and rather than
climb all the way up to the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn I decided to
camp on the grassy shelf a couple of hundred feet below the summit,
where I had stayed on my last trip. Luckily I had saved the location
as a waypoint in my eTrex, which made locating it much easier in the
mist. The nearby cairn, overlooking Cwm Eigau, which I remember being
huge, turned out to be just a small pile of rock.

<p>
It was only about 5:00pm when I set up the tent. Although it was very
misty, there was no breeze, so I was able to cook in the open on the
rocks just behind the tent. After we had eaten we settled down in the
tent for a snooze. Around 7:00pm I unzipped the flysheet just as the
clouds around us started to disperse. We clambered out of the tent and
soon we could see all the surrounding tops. A small patch of cloud was
flowing over the summit of Pen hyr Helgi Ddu below us. It was as if someone was
pouring a thick white liquid over the summit. However, once the cloud
had flowed over the summit, it dispersed into nothing. We spent some
time wandering around admiring the views. I pointed out tomorrow's
route to Ella, so she could see that there was only a small amount of
ascent with most of the day being a traverse over the summits. We
tuned in finally just before it got dark around 9:00pm.

<p>
Unlike our trip up Moel Siabod we slept well and it was after 6:00am
when I woke up. Looking out of the tent I could see most of the sky
was clouded over, but it was well above the summits. After a breakfast
of hot cereal start and hot chocolate, we packed the tent away and
started up the ridge towards the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn. After a
brief pause on the summit we started descending towards Bwlch Cyfryw
drum. As we began the descent we were exposed to a strong south
westerly wind, which was to buffet us all along the ridge. We made our
way over the Black Ladders and up to the summit of Carnedd Dafydd,
where we sheltered in one of the many stone shelters. After a brief
rest we dropped down a short way before the ascent to the final summit
of Pen yr Ole Wen, where we saw the first person of the day.

<p>
Once we had crossed the summit we were sheltered from the wind as we
wound our way down the south east ridge. We scrambled down the final
section which lead to some boggy ground at the entrance to Cwm
Lloer. I was wearing my Inov8's, so had to perform a few jumps
between stones to avoid getting wet feet. Since our last trip up Moel
Siabod, where Ella's boots had let in water like sieves, we had bought
her some new Hi-Tec boots. Her new boots performed well, being both
comfortable and waterproof. We followed the path down next to the
stream passing the MAM hut at Glan Dena. We stopped to chat with a
couple of MAM members who were busy filling in holes in the track up
to the hut.
</p>

<p>
After short walk along the road, we arrived back at the car. I chucked
all the gear into the back and we set off to Pete's Eats for an early lunch.
</p>

<p>
I had worn my Inov-8 Roclite 295 shoes for the walk. I wasn't sure how
they would perform as I was carrying a heavy sack over steep and rocky
terrain. In the event they were really comfortable and I was able to
scramble up and down steep ground while carrying a heavy sack with no
problems. Ella's new Hi-Tec boots were comfy and waterproof. I was
pleased that we had reasonable conditions for the walk. Although Ella
found the wind a bit of a problem, it was nothing like as bad as on
our Moel Siabod trip. The low cloud of the previous day had cleared in
the evening and we had enjoyed great views from the tent and during
our walk along the ridge.

I am a big fan of my Thermarest Neoair, which is very comfortable,
light and packs down small. However, I find that I tend to roll off it
when I am asleep. Recently I needed to buy another light weight mat
for one of the family. Rather than just buy another Neoair, I did some
research and discovered the <a href="http://www.facewest.co.uk/Exped-SynMat-Ultralite.html">Exped Synmat Ultralite</a> .
</p>

<p>
Like the Neoair the Synmat is an inflatable, but there are significant
differences. The Neoair relies on internal baffles, which prevent
convection, to achieve its insulation. The Synmat is filled with
Primaloft, which is laminated to the walls. This prevents the filling
from migrating and allows for greater loft.
</p>

<p>
The Neoair uses a single valve for both inflation and deflation, but
the Synmat has two separate one way valves. Most people inflate the
Neoair by mouth. You can inflate the Synmat the same way, but moisture
from your breath will eventually compromise the effectiveness of the
Primaloft. Exped sell a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGIi7Of2ZFU">pillow pump</a> , which functions both as a pillow
filled with expanding foam and an air pump. I decided to buy a pillow
pump, which works well both as a pump and a very comfortable pillow.
</p>

<p>
There is one other important difference in construction between the
Synmat and the Neoair. The inflatable tubes in the Neoair run
horizontally, whilst those in the Synmat run vertically along the
length of the mat. The outer tubes of the Synmat are slightly larger
than the inner tubes, which makes it harder to roll off the mat.
</p>

<p>
So how do the two mats compare for sleeping on? I haven't tested
either mat in really cold conditions, but both kept me warm. Note the
Synmat has a slightly higher R value, so in theory should provide
better insulation. Both mats require about the same effort to inflate
and pack down to a very similar size. However, I did find the Synmat
slightly more comfortable than the Neoair and more importantly I
didn't roll off the Synmat during the night.
</p>

<p>
The Neoair feels quite flimsy compared to the Synmat, but I haven't
had a problem with punctures. A nice detail is that the Synmat comes
with a repair kit, whereas you have to buy one for the Neoair.
</p>

<p>
So which do I prefer? It's a very close call, I like both mats and
compared to other types of sleeping mat like my old Karrimat, or self
inflating mats, they are streets ahead in terms of comfort, lightness
and pack size. I marginally prefer the Synmat as I find it slightly
more comfortable and so far I haven't rolled off it.

I had wanted to try my Zephyros for some time, but hadn't had an
opportunity to take it into the mountains. The weather had settled
into the pattern of recent years, with a dry Spring, but wet and
unsettled weather throughout the Summer. However, a brief window of
opportunity was forecast mid-week with bad weather clearing in the
afternoon, followed by a brighter day.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to use one of the routes over the Arans from <a href="http://v-g.me.uk">v-g's</a>
site. However, it didn't look as though the good weather would last
long enough. So, I decided on a late afternoon ascent of Moel Siabod
from Capel Curig, camping near to the summit and returning to Capel
early the next morning. It was school holidays (which probably
explains the bad weather), so I persuaded one of my daughters (Ella)
that camping on top of a mountain in dodgy weather was a good idea.

<p>
Driving over the Llandegla Moors, rain began to pour down from the
grey skies, so much for the promised clear weather in the
afternoon. When we reached the A5, it had stopped raining, but the sky
was entirely covered in low grey clouds. Driving up from Betwys y Coed
I caught occasional glimpses of the summit of Siabod trough the
cloud. It wasn't raining continuously, but there were frequent heavy
showers. We had tea in the Pinnacle cafe in Capel Curig before driving
back to the car park near to the Bryn y Glo cafe.

<p>
Ella sat in the car while I packed the rucksack in the rain. When we
set off the sky was covered in low grey cloud and it was raining
intermittently. I glanced over the bridge at Pont y ??? and noticed
that the level of water in the river was well up for the time of
year. After a short distance we turned right and started up the steep
farm track, following the diversion that takes the path away from the
farm buildings. As we made our way along the track over the moors, I
could see that the summit of Siabod was covered in cloud. Rather than
try and camp on the summit, I decided that we would be better off
camping next to Llyn y Foel and hope that the weather was better in
the morning..

<p>
This was Ella's first trip up Siabod and I was regretting not waiting
for better conditions. Also, her boots were leaking badly and since
the path was running with water, her feet were soon soaked. We made
our way up through the old quarry workings and stopped to stare into a
couple of the flooded workings. On a sunny day the water appears in
vivid colours, caused by the different dissolved minerals. However,
today it just looked grey, like the sky above.

<p>
As we approached Llyn y Foel a few breaks appeared in the clouds and
the summit cleared. After a bit of deliberation we decided to continue
over the Ddear Ddu ridge to the summit. Unfortunately, the path past Llyn
y Foel was very boggy and Ella's feet got even wetter. The Ddear Ddu ridge was
a pleasant scramble, but needed care as the rock was quite
greasy. Also I was hampered by carrying a heavy pack. I made my way
slowly up the ridge, with Ella skipping along behind like a faun.

<p>
I could see the clouds racing over the summit and wondered how windy
it was going to be on top. The forecast was for winds gusting up to
45mph, but falling back to 25mph later in the day. By the time we had
reached the final rocks below the summit, the cloud had risen some way
above the summit and there were some large patches of blue sky
appearing. Once we got onto the summit ridge it was very windy and
Ella sat in the summit shelter, covered by my bothy bag, while I went
in search of a suitable spot to pitch the tent.

<p>
There is a nice flat area to the North of the summit, which has great
views over Snowdon and the Glyders, where I pitched the tent on my
 last trip. However, it was exposed to the full force of the westerly
wind, which was blowing me about and was definitely not the place to
pitch the tent. I back tracked to the area on the southern slope, just below
the summit ridge, where I found a nice flat area close to the summit
cairn.

<p>
I unpacked the Zephyros and had it pitched in less than 10 minutes. I
climbed back up to the summit shelter and fetched Ella and we put all
our gear into the tent. The Zephyros 2 is very cosy for two and you
can only just fit two sleeping mats side by side. It was now about
8:30pm and the light was fading. I found it was possible to cook in
the porch, but you really need to have the flysheet open to avoid
setting light to the tent! After a cup of hot chocolate and some
porridge and sultanas, we settled down for the night. Contrary to the
forecast the wind didn't drop at all during the night. We could hear
the roar of the gale on the other side of the summit ridge and blasts
of wind that made it over the ridge rattled the Zephyros. However, the
tent stood up to the wind and sharp showers during the night without
any problems.

<p>
The wind kept us awake most of the night and we dropped off to sleep
about 4:00pm, waking again about 6:30am. Wisps of cloud were blowing
over the summit and the wind hadn't dropped at all during the
night. After a cup of hot chocolate we decide to pack up and go down
to the valley for breakfast. We crossed over to the northern side of
the summit ridge and dropped down below the crest, to avoid scrambling
over the rocks. We were now exposed to the full force of the wind. I
was being buffeted and Ella was struggling to stay on her feet. I
could see sheets of rain blowing along the Ogwen Valley over Capel
Curig. Luckily, although we were exposed to the gale, the rain showers
passed us by. It felt much more like Autumn than early August.

<p>
Once we started dropping down the southern slopes we were sheltered
from the wind and made quick progress down the eroded path back to
the end of the track. We got back to the car about 9:00am and went
straight round to Pete's Eats for breakfast!

I spend most of my time wearing trainers. Over the last couple of
years I have bought various Karrimor trainers/trail shoes from
Sportsdirect. These have been OK for just knocking about in, but not
particularly good for mountain walking. The main problem was the soles
of my feet got sore and I could feel almost every sharp stone digging
into my feet. So for mountain walking, I bought some moderately priced
Hi-Tec walking boots, which were very comfortable, but the soles
weren't great on wet rock, or for scrambling.
</p>

<p>
Recently I noticed that the soles of my feet were hurting almost all
of the time in my Karrimors. A quick look at the soles revealed that
they were paper thin and I was almost walking barefoot. I had read
various blog posts about Inov8's range of trail/running
shoes. Unfortunately, there aren't any local stockists who keep a
decent range actually in stock. Since I didn't want to keep wandering
around in my karrimors with paper thin soles, I visited my local
GoOutdoors, who did have a small number of different Inov8's in stock.
</p>

<p>
When I got there it turned out that the only pair I had in my size
were the Roclite 295. I had no idea what their intended use was
(running, walking), but as soon as I tried them on I felt at home in
them. A brief walk around the shop confirmed that they fitted me and
were indeed very comfortable. I bought them and chucked out my old
pair of trainers immediately.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward a couple of weeks and we were going on holiday to
Chamonix. Since I was taking a load of climbing gear and we were up
against our weight limit for checked baggage, I decided to leave my
Meindl boots at home and use the Roclite 295's for walking.
</p>

<p>
On the first trip up to Lac Blanc in damp weather with a thin layer
of snow, they were perfect. Although they aren't fully waterproof, the
toe section is. Despite the snow my feet didn't get wet. Even better,
although I was carrying a reasonably loaded sack with everyone's gear
in it, my feet were comfortable. I was able to clamber over wet rocks
without slipping. A couple more walks, involving some scrambling over
rough terrain only increased my appreciation of these boots. The
cushioning worked really well on rocky trails.
</p>

<p>
You can see INOV8's specification for these boots <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&amp;P=5050973003&amp;L=27">here</a> .

For a couple of years I have been using <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Xen">Xen</a> on my file server to run
various Linux virtual computers. Initially I started by running it on
Ubuntu, but when Ubuntu dropped support for Xen kernels, I moved to
Debian Lenny and then Debian Squeeze.
</p>

<p>
Recently I bought a couple of HP Proliant <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/15351-15351-4237916-4237918-4237917-4248009.html">Microservers</a> . One of these
was to replace my current server and the other to use as a firewall
and run a couple of VM's. Transferring my main Xen server to the new
box was easy. However, have been having problems setting up my
firewall box.
</p>

<p>
My firewall box has two wthernet cards. One connected to my internal
network and the other connected to an ADSL modem. Installing Squeeze
and Xen worked fine, up to the point when I tried to configure
pppoe. The configuration went OK, but when I rebooted Xen complained
about eth1 (my internal interface) being busy or unavailable. The Xen
wiki suggests removing all non essential ipv4 settings from your
/etc/network/interfaces. However, mine was already pretty bare and
basically identical to that on my other Microserver, which was working
fine.
</p>

<p>
After re-installs I established that booting with the standard debian
kernel worked fine. Both eth1 and my ADSL interface were initialized
correctly. However, rebooting into the Xen kernel gave the same
problem with errors about eth1 being busy or unavailable. he thing
that caused the errors was configuring the pppoe interface. if I left
it unconfigured everything worked correctly. Finally I decided that
for whatever reason I wasn't going to be able to get Xen to work in
this configuration.
</p>

<p>
I have never tried the virtualization already built into the Linux
kernel (KVM), but decided to experiment to see how it worked for my
requirements. Initially I tried installing Lucid, but ran into a
problem where the installer couldn't install grub2 on my RAID1 boot
disks. Rather fed up with problems by now I went with the latest Natty
server, which installed without a problem.
</p>

<p>
There are several good documents about setting up KVM in Ubuntu:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/virtualization-with-kvm-on-ubuntu-10.10">HowToForge</a></li>
<li>Ubuntu <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/ubuntu-vm-builder.html">vm-builder</a>
</li>
<li>KVM <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking#Network%20Bridge%20Does%20Not%20Appear%20in%20Virt-Manager">networking</a>
</li>
<li>General Ubuntu <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM">KVM</a> documentation</li>
<li>
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation">Installing</a> KVM on Ubuntu</li>
</ul>
<p>
After correcting an initial configuration error, I soon had bridged
networking and a test VM with Ubuntu Lucid up and running.
</p>

<p>
Having successfully set up KVM, I think that I shall probably migrate
my Debain Xen server to Ubuntu using KVM. Although Xen is working fine
on that server, I don't really want to have to maintain two different
network virtualization technologies.

Over the years I have had quite a few vacuum flasks. Whilst the ones
with the glass insides keep the liquid hot for a long time, they are
rather fragile for outdoor use. There's nothing worse than slogging up
to a summit, getting out your flask for a nice hot drink and finding
your drink full of pieces of glass! We do have a few stainless steel
flasks, but these are heavy and don't keep drinks hot for a full days
walking.
</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Thermos Ultimate</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/thermos.jpg" class="rounded
float-left" alt=""><img src="galleries/thermos.jpg"></a></b>



<p>
Recently I heard about the Thermos Ultimate stainless steel flask,
which claims to keep liquids hot for 24hrs. It is a proper vacuum
flask. In other words there is a vacuum between the two walls of the
flask. Most cheaper flasks fill the gap between the walls with some
sort of insulating material, as it's much cheaper to produce.
</p>

<p>
The Thermos Ultimate is available in 0.5l and 0.8l sizes and costs
around £20 from <a href="http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.209-6038.aspx">Tesco</a> Direct. This isn't cheap, but the flask has a
10 year guarantee. I ordered the 0.5l size, as it's about the right
size for bike rides in the winter.
</p>

<p>
When it arrived I wanted to test it out. First I filled it with
boiling water from the kettle and left it to stand for 10
minutes. Next I poured the water out and refilled the flask with
boiling water from the kettle. Unfortunately, I don't have an accurate
thermometer that will read up to 100 Centrigade, so my test wasn't
very scientific. After six hours, the longest I would expect to keep a
liquid hot during a normal day out, I poured out a cup of water from
the flask. I stuck my finger in and immediately removed it, as the
water was so hot. So probably well over 60C. I left the remainder of
the water in the flask overnight and repeated the test the next
morning, about 19 hours after I had first filled the flask. The water
was still too hot to keep my finger in for more than a second.
</p>

<p>
So overall I was very impressed with the flask. It's not particularly
heavy, the 0.5l version is 310g. In fact I was so impressed that I
ended up ordering the 0.8l version.

It was the week of the Royal Wedding, which I wasn't interested in
watching. The weather, which had been warm and sunny for weeks, looked
as though it would hold out for at least two more days, so I decided
to go to North Wales for a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
I intended to follow one of <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/G0084/G0084.htm">v-g</a> two day routes over the Southern
Carneddau. I had done the section traversing the main ridge, from Pen
yr Ole Wen to Carnedd Llewelyn and then on over Pen yr Helgi Du, as a
day walk several times in the past.
</p>

<p>
I arrived in Capel Curig about 10:00am and easily found a space in the
car park behind Joe Browns. I wasn't sure about leaving the car there
overnight, but couldn't find any signs forbidding overnight
parking. Before setting off on the walk, I called in at the Pinnacle
store to get a sandwich for lunch and buy a bottle of Sprite.
</p>

<p>
When I had finished packing my sack, I set off down the old A5 towards
Ogwen. I walked past Gallt yr Ogof and soon the East face of Tryfan
appeared round the side of the hill. The walk along the valley seemed
further than I remembered, but soon I was passing through the two camp
sites of Gwern Gof Isaf and Gwern Gof Uchaf. The track emerges onto
the A5 nearly opposite to the Glan Dena path. The footpath is
waymarked and proceeds uphill next to the wall of ???. After a short
distance the wall is crossed via a ladder style and the path carries
on uphill. This section can be wet, but the month of dry weather
ensured that the ground was bone dry. The path follows the Afon Lloer
up towards Ffynnon Lloer, which remains invisible until you are on the
south ridge of Pen yr Ole Wen.
</p>

<p>
The south ridge is a pleasant easy scramble and much preferable to the
horrible slog of the normal route from Ogwen. It was while I was making
my way up the steep slope to the bottom of the south ridge that I
began to realize how heavy my sack felt. It had been fine in the
valley, but was really slowing me down going uphill. Usually, I am
quick going uphill, but slow on descents. This time I was really
struggling going up.
</p>

<p>
I stopped to refill my two Platypus one litre bottles and the 600ml
Sorite bottle from the Afon Lloer. I was aware that I wasn't going to
find any more water from here until I reached Llyn Colwyd the next
day. In his book "Backpacking in Wales", Showell Styles describes
finding a spring near ????, but I didn't think I would be so lucky. I
needed to cook at least one dehydrated meal, have a couple of hot
drinks and also have water to drink for the rest of today. I had
worked out that two and a half litres would probably be enough, but
ideally I would have liked a bit more, especially as it was a hot day.
</p>

<p>
The South ridge seemed to go on for a very long way, but eventually I
arrived at the summit of Pen yr Ole Wen, where I flopped down by the
cairn. I ate a couple of Kellogs bars and drank some of my water and
began to feel a bit better. Now I had gained the plateau most of the
ascent was over and my heavy rucksack didn't seem quite as heavy.
</p>

<p>
I set off towards Carnedd Dafydd over the stony ground. The views were
spectacular, with no clouds and very little haze. Although it was half
term week, there weren't that many people about. I stopped for another
rest at the huge cairn just below the summit of Carnedd Dafydd, then
made the short descent towards the top of Ysgolion Duon. The last
time I had passed this way was after my winter ascent of Western Gully
in 1986. We had emerged on the summit in the dark,  it was a
cloudless night and the moon was out. Stupidly I didn't use the
compass and we ended up descending back to Ogwen, rather than Gerlan.
</p>

<p>
This time I could see my objective, Carnedd Llewelyn clearly in front
of me, so there would be no excuse for getting lost! As I walked along
the edge of the cliffs I began to feel a cold breeze from the East. By
the time I had reached to foot of the SE ridge of Carnedd Llewelyn it
was strong enough to buffet me about. Luckily I was sheltered on the
ascent of the ridge, but on the summit I was once again exposed to the full force of the
wind. Time was getting on and I was quite tired, so I
abandoned my idea of going to look at the refuge on Foel Goch and set
off down the descent towards Craig yr Ysfa.
</p>

<p>
A few hundred feet below the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn there was a
flat grassy area away from the path. It was in a hollow sheltered from
the strong easterly wind, with a jumble of rocks behind to give more
shelter. I soon had the tent up and got the stove going so I could
have a hot chocolate. I had to be careful how I moved, as I kept
getting cramp in my legs. More worryingly my left calf muscle was
quite swollen, although not painful. Eighteen months ago I had
suffered a DVT in my right leg and I was fairly certain that I now had
one in my left leg.
</p>

<p>
I didn't feel like a big meal, so finished off the remains of the
sandwich I had bought in Capel Curig for lunch. Reviewing the water
situation, I had enough to make a hot breakfast cereal and a couple
more mugs of hot chocolate, whilst still having a bit more than a
quarter of a litre to last me until I reached Llyn Colwyd. I settled
into my sleeping bag and started listening to a few Podcasts on the
iPod. A couple of times during the night I nipped outside to look at
the stars and watch the light of the coastal towns. It was quite cold
outside and according to my watch the temperature inside the tent was
2.7C, so it was probably about freezing outside.
</p>

<p>
I slept quite well, but was awake when it started to get light around
5:00am, although the sun didn't come up until nearly 6:00am. I made
myself another hot chocolate and had a hot breakfast cereal, which I
hoped would set me up for the day. My legs didn't feel too bad and
most of the swelling around my left calf had gone down overnight.
</p>

<p>
I was packed up and ready to go shortly before 7:00am. I made my way
down past Craig yr Ysfa stopping to look down at the top part of
Amphitheatre Buttress and Pinnacle Wall. I met an early riser coming
up the rock step on my way down to the col. Once I reached the col, I
had another quick look at my left calf, which was now swollen up
again, but not painful. I toyed with the idea of descending to the
forestry road below and returning to Capel Curig along the
valley. However, I didn't fancy the descent down the loose slope and
decided to climb up to Pen yr Helgi Du and see how I felt. I
always enjoy the scramble up this ridge and although there were a
couple of low clouds blowing past, most of the sky was clear. The summit
was closer to the top of the ridge than I remembered, which was a
pleasant surprise. However, it was shrouded in mist when I arrived.
</p>

<p>
I had another look at my swollen leg and decided that I may as well
continue over Pen yr Helgi Du and see how things went. I got out the
map and took a bearing and of course as soon as I had done this the
mist cleared and I could see exactly where I wanted to go. It's quite
a long descent to ???? and I wasn't looking forward to the re-ascent
up Pen Llithrig y Wrach. However, the slope wasn't as bad as it looked and
I was soon over the steepest part. The summit was still some distance
away, but it was easy going. I don't recall ever having climbed Pen
Llithrig y Wrach before, it was a first for me. It was still early,
so I had the summit to myself.
</p>

<p>
I drank the last of my water and began descending the South East
ridge. On my way down I met three other people sweating up towards the
summit. There is a small path most of the way down. However, I lost it
a few hundred feet above the lake. I bush-whacked down the final
descent through some tussocks and boulders to reach the path alongside
Llyn Colwyd. My original intention was to continue along the ridge of
Creigiau Gleision before dropping back into Capel Curig. However, I
was concerned about the state of my leg and decided to climb up to the
col above Llyn Colwyd and follow the path along leading South East
past the end of Creigiau Gleision, back towards Capel Curig.
</p>

<p>
I had to cross the stream that runs into Llyn Colwyd, but the first
bridge I came to was blocked off with wire. Looking at the map, I
could see there was another bridge a short distance away. I filled my
water bottle from the stream and set off. In a few hundred yards I
came to the bridge and crossed over the stream. Once on the other side
the path drops gently towards the A5 coming out near to a house called
Bron Heulog. There remained a half mile walk along the road back to
the car.
</p>

<p>
I made myself a couple of brews and set off for Pete's Eats in
Llanberis for a fry up. A trip to the hospital the next day confirmed
that I had another DVT, so back to taking the rat poison!

It's hard to find things to do in the February school half term
week. The weather is usually bad, at least as far as doing anything
outside with children is concerned and the hours of daylight are
limited. Last year we decided to spend a few days in North Wales and
were rewarded with perfect winter weather - clear skies, temperatures
well below freezing and plenty of snow. This year we decided to go
away for the whole week. We were staying at <a href="http://www.tycochsnowdonia.co.uk/self-catering-sg.asp">Hen Ysgubor</a> , which I can
highly recommend.

Unlike last year the weather was more mixed. Most days started misty
with showers, but generally cleared by lunchtime. I made my annual
ascent of M Mawr and for the first time the top was covered in
cloud. We spent half a day <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/cycling/llanberis_circuit.html">cycling</a> on a short circular route around
Llanberis. In fact we enjoyed the ride so much, we did it twice! We
spent a few mornings at the <a href="http://www.beaconclimbing.com/">Beacon Climbing Centre</a> , which has a nice
relaxed attitude to letting children use the walls.
</p>

<p>
I had packed a rope, thinking that we might do Sentries Ridge on
Mynydd Mawr, but the weather wasn't really good enough. However, I was
determined to try and get in at least one route on rock. So one
afternoon after going for a bike ride, three of us drove round to
Ogwen. The plan was to do a climb on Tryfan Bach, which is only 10
minutes walk from the road, has a selection of easy climbs and an straightforward
descent.

When we arrived things didn't look promising. Cloud was boiling down
Cwm Tryfan, although Tryfan Bach was just in the clear. It was also
very windy, even down by the road. Luckily, even though it was
February it didn't feel all that cold. We tramped up to the bottom of
the crag, where there were several other parties climbing. I decided
to climb the arete at the near end of the crag. All the routes are
about the same grade and you can climb anywhere at about VDiff,
although many of the routes are easier. However, as it's at the edge
of the crag the arete feels pleasantly exposed. I unravelled the rope
and we geared up. The crag s about 200ft high and as there were three
of us climbing on a single 50 metre rope, doubled, we were in for
two and a bit pitches of climbing.
</p>

<p>
I started up the arete, but as I gained height I became increasingly
exposed to the wind blowing up the valley. I teetered over from the
arete to a crack a few feet to the right, where the gear was much
better. I reached the end of the rope, just as I got to a convenient
recess, where I belayed. The second pitch was more interesting, as the
wind had increased to the point where it was quite difficult to stay
in balance. I reached another recess and brought Ella up. She buried
herself in a hole just below me out of the wind, while I brought John
up. It wasn't far to the top and soon we were all sheltering behind a
rock while I sorted out the gear. Ella was very cold, so I gave her my
Paramo Tores gilet to warm her up a bit. When we emerged from our
shelter it was hard to stand upright in the wind. However, we soon
scrambled over the top and dropped down the other side, where we were
more sheltered. The children seemed to have enjoyed themselves,
despite the challenging conditions and it didn't take long to get to
Pete's Eats for tea.
