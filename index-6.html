The route is described starting from Whitchurch, but since it's
circular, you could start from anywhere. There is only one short
steep hill between Tittenley and Calverhall. Apart from Whitchurch,
which does have some cycle lanes, most of the route is on quiet
country lanes.
</p>

<p>
From Whitchurch turn up Claypit Street, which is just before the new
Sainsbury. Alternatively, you can follow Sustrans Route 45. The road
leads slowly uphill past a cemetary and the ??? camping farm. A
downhill section leads to a left hand bend, where you take the road
(Ossmere Lane) on the right. Shortly after crossing the railway you
will join Sustrans Route 45, which comes in from the right. If you
look in the hedge on the left hand side your will see ???? Mercian
statue.
</p>

<p>
At the T junction turn right into Hollyhurst road. You will be able to
see and obelisk to your right, which is a war memorial in the grounds
of Combermere Abbey. Shortly before you go underneath he railway,
there is a style and a grassy area on the right, which provides a
convenient stopping place to eat and drink. Immediately after you go
under the railway bridge turn right and then a short distance further
on turn right again at a fork in the road. You are now on Sustrnas
route 70. This will lead you through Aston, past the corn mills, to the main Whitchurch -
Nantwich road. Cross this and head off along Shepenhall Lane. Ignore
all the turnings to the left and right. Just after you cross over a
brook Shepenhall Lane changes into Rookery Lane.
</p>

<p>
Cross over the main road to Audlem and follow Royals Green
Lane. After half a mile or so, you will come to a T junction opposite
the end of Wilkesley Wood. Turn left along Wilkesley Lane and cycle
through the hamlet of Wilkesley. After about a mile and a half, at
the end of a long red brick wall you will pass the two lodges which
were one of the entrances to the Shavington Estate. Carry on along
the road until it bends sharply to the left. At this point you need
to take the lane to the right, which leads past the large pool at
Tittenley, on your left hand side.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after passing the Tittenley pool there are another two lodges,
which mark what used to be another entrance to the Shavington
Estate. Turn up the lane to the right, which is the only real climb on
this route. It doesn't last very long and leads you to another T
junction. Turn right here (signposted Calverhall). After half a mile
of so you will pass the grand iron gates, which were the main entrance
to the Shavington Estate. Carry on until you reach the small village
of Calverhall. The Jack pub on the left is well worth a visit and
serves good food and beer.
</p>

<p>
Turn right at the T junction and cycle into Ightfield. There is a
convenient brick bus shelter here, which is a good place to eat your
sandwiches if it's raining. Follow the bend round to the left. Just
on the right there is a large grassy playground, with a couple of
benches. This is a nice place to eat your sandwiches in good weather!
</p>

<p>
The road continues on into the two villages of Ash. It's a short easy
climb and there is a nice duck pond where you can linger. From Ash the
road descends to meet the Whitchurch bypass. Cross straight over the
roundabout and enter a small industrial estate. Carry straight on at
the apex of the sharp left hand bend which allows you to regain the
old main road into Whitchurch, via a short stretch of footpath. From
here it's only a short ride back to the town centre.

One of my original goals in using Jekyll as a static site generator
was to make it easier to write posts and thus increasing the
number of my posts. However, I found Jekyll had a couple of
idiosyncrasies with categorizing and tagging posts that made it
awkward for me to use. It was also difficult to re-theme the site,
without doing an almost ground up re-write.
</p>

<p>
I searched Google for another static site generator and tried a few
out before I discovered <a href="http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/">Pelican</a> .This seemed to fit in with all my
requirements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>written in Python, which makes it easier for me to hack on.</li>
<li>good handling of categories, tags and static pages.</li>
<li>easy to use <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">template</a> language (Jinja2).</li>
<li>themes</li>
<li>it was simple to write a new reader that understood my existing
YAML files, so I didn't have to rewrite all my old posts.</li>
<li>I can use Emacs to write my posts.</li>

I managed to crack my plastic mug and was about to buy another one
when I decided to investigate the alternatives. I don't like metal
mugs of any sort. I end up burning my finger and lips whenever I use
them. Mugs take up space in my rucksack. I can try to stuff things
inside them to try and reduce the dead space, but this isn't always
possible.

<p>
I had read several reviews of Sea to Summits <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/71">X-Mug</a> . It's constructed
from silicone with a rigid rim. Its unique selling point is that it
collapses into a flat disc. It holds around 500ml and the rim
around the top prevents scalded fingers. I had a couple of concerns
about it. Firstly I wondered how stable it was, I didn't want it
collapsing in the tent when it was full of a hot drink. Secondly some
reviewers said that it retained the taste of the previous
contents. However, several other people said that they hadn't found
this to be a problem.
</p>

<p>
I nipped into my local <a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com">Cotswold</a> to have a look at one. After
examining one I was happy that it wouldn't collapse accidentally. I
decided to take a chance that it wouldn't retain the taste of any
previous contents and bought one. When I got it home I tried several
drink in it and confirm that after washing it doesn't retain the
taste of the previous contents. It was find with hot drinks, I didn't
scale either my fingers or my mouth. Drinks do cool down a bit faster
than in my old plastic beaker. However, this is an advantage for me
as I like to have my hot drink as soon as I have made it and it
doesn't stay in the cup long enough to get cold!

At last the weather was showing signs of improving with good forecasts
for today and for the next few days. I took my son to his
rowing session in Chester and carried on towards North Wales along
the A55.
</p>

<p>
I had decided to do a route from Cwm Eigiau. I have been walking over
the Carneddau for many years, but never started from Cwm Eigiau. I
took the windy single track road up from Tal-y-bont, which leads to a
small car park in the heart of the Cwm. Luckily the only vehicle I met
on the road was the farmer's Landrover at one of the gates. The car
park was quite crowded, with several mini-buses and people milling
about. I pulled in at the far end next to and old Post Office van,
which had been converted into a camper van. By the time I had sorted
out my rucsack it was 11:00am. I set off along the path from the car
park to the NW leading to Clogwynyren. The plan was to gain the ridge
somewhere around Foel Fras and continue towards Foel Grach.
</p>

<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Wild pony</b></p>

<p>
I reached the bridge over Pant y Griafolen and followed the path to
where it reached Afon Garreg-wen. The plan was to follow the stream
uphill to meet another path shown on the map, which crossed it at
about 707677. This path would lead me on the plateau. The slope
alternated between boggy sphagnum and steep grass and bilberry. Steep
sections were interspersed with short flat shelves. I couldn't see the
top of the ridge above me, but I judge how far I had to go by looking
over to the rocks on the summit of Foel Fras. The tedium of the ascent
was relieved by a couple of wild ponies, who allowed me to approach
quite close to them. I never found the path that is shown on the map,
but eventually I arrived on the plateau just to the South of Foel
Fras. I dumped the sack and did a quick there and back to the summit
before continuing on to Carnedd Gwellian, where I stopped for
lunch. Ahead of me I could see a cap of cloud over Foel Goch and
Carnedd Llewelyn, but it looked as though it was slowly lifting. By
the time I had eaten my lunch Foel Grach was clear.
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Path to Foel Grach</b></p>

<p>
I made my way along the plateau to Foel Grach and paused to have a
look round the emergency shelter. The last time I can remember
visiting Foel Grach was in September 1982. At that time there was a
Visitors Book, which I had signed. I opened the door to the shelter
and went inside for a look round. There is no longer a Visitors Book
and inside it was quite damp, but tidy with several small
benches. Whilst it is probably very useful in an emergency, I can't
imagine wanting to stay there otherwise. It's also quite hard to
find, being sort of hidden in the slope below the summit.
</p>

<p>
After taking a few photos I continued over to the summit of Carnedd
Llewelyn. The top hundred feet or so were misted out. However, as I
started dropping down the SE ridge I soon dropped out of the cloud. I
paused briefly at a spot, just off the path, where I had camped on a
couple of previous trips for a drink and to admire the
views. Continuing on over Craig yr Ysfa there were fine views all
around. Often at this time of year the atmosphere is hazy, but I could
see the Moelwyns and Cader in the distance. I scrambled down the rocky
step above Bwlch Erol Farchog and started up the short steep scramble
to the summit of Pen yr Helgi Du. Behind me I could see a family group
with two children struggling to find a way down the rock section to
the col. However, eventually they managed it without incident.
</p>

<p>
It was now 5:00pm. I had thought about continuing on to camp on Pen
Llithrig y Wrach. However, on the scramble up the ridge I had began to
get cramp in my legs, a sign that I needed to stop to rehydrate and
eat something. Also I think that the summit of Pen yr Helgi Du is a
better viewpoint.
</p>

<p>
There is no reliable water supply on the Carneddau ridge, so all water
must be carried up. I tend to sweat a lot, so had dragged three litres
up with me. This is just enough to last me through a hot day with an
evening meal and a breakfast the next morning, leaving a small amount
to drink on the route back to the car.
</p>

<p>

<p>
I soon had the tent up and after a drink and some food felt much
better. It was a perfect evening. The cloud, which had been covering
many summits, cleared leaving perfect views in all directions. The sun
disappeared behind Carnedd Llewelyn about 8:00pm. There was a bright moon
and the odd shooting star could be seen, perhaps the precursors to the
Perseid showers.
</p>

<p>

<p>
About 4:00am the next morning I had to get out of the tent to answer a
call of nature. Although the official sunrise was about 45 minutes
away, The horizon to the East had a faint tinge of red. There was no
wind and rather than clamber back into my sleeping bag I started to
cook breakfast, so I could sit outside and enjoy the sunrise. By
6:00am I had packed up and was ready to start the day, with the sun
now well above the horizon. I don't like heat, so wanted to get most
of my walking done before it got too hot.
</p>

<p>
The plan was to climb Pen Llithrig y Wrach and then somehow get back
down to Cwm Eigiau. My Harvey's map didn't show any path down from Pen
Llithrig y Wrach into Cwm Eigiau, but it looked easy enough to go
along the NE ridge and drop off the end. Also I had some notion that
there would be a path from Bwlych tri Marchog  down into Cwm Eigiau. Descending
the slope to the bwylch it was obvious that there was no path down
into Cwm Eigiau. It didn't look too hard from above, but I presume
that there must be hidden difficulties, as it would be the most
obvious route between Ogwen and Cwm Eigiau.
</p>

<p>
From the summit of Pen Llithrig y Wrach there was an obvious path
leading to the NE down the ridge. However, once I had descended a few
hundred feet the going became very boggy. I was wearing trail shoes
and any idea of keeping my feet dry was abandoned as I splodged though
the sphagnum. Further along the ridge the path became more indistinct,
but was obviously heading for Moel Eilio. I didn't want to go that
far, but hoped to meet the path shown on the map that crossed the
ridge from Hafod y rhiw. However, I couldn't find the path, or maybe I
just didn't go quite far enough.

<p>
I decided to cut down the side of the ridge above Hafod y rhiw.  The
going was very difficult, with waist high heather and lots of hidden
rocks. At one point my left leg dropped into a hole between two rocks
hidden under the heather. Luckily no there was no serious damage. An
accident here would have been unfortunate as there is no phone signal
and nobody knew where I was. Trying to crawl down would have been
almost impossible. After a few hundred feet I came across what at
first I thought was a sheep track. However, a bit further on I saw a
couple of boot prints and eventually it turned into a path leading to
Hafod y rhiw.
</p>

<p>
I trudged back along the track in the hot sunshine to the car park,
where the couple in the red Post Office van kindly made me a cup of
tea. Apparently, they used to be keen backpackers, but the woman had a
back injury which meant she could no longer carry a load. They spent
most of their time touring the country living in the camper van and
going for day walks.

On the way back down the narrow lane to Tal y Bont, I met a tractor
coming up to row some hay. Luckily there was just enough space to get
past with a bit of toing and froing. I would like to do another trip
from Cwm Eigiau. However, the range of possibilities is limited by the
small number of ways of accessing the ridge, unlike the Ogwen side
where there are countless possible variations.

On Wednesday MWIS was promising 70% chance of clear summits on the
Thursday and Friday. After months of rain, this looked like a chance
for an overnight trip over the Arans. However, on Thursday morning the
forecast was for only 10% chance of clear summits, but with a promise
of clouds clearing in the evening with Friday still forecast as 70%
clear.

Ridge of Aran Benllyn</b></p>

<p>
I decided on a late start from Llanuwchllyn on the Wednesday leaving
the small car park at the end of the village about 2:00pm. The weather
didn't look too promising. The summits of the Arenigs on the opposite
side of the valley were covered in cloud and it looked as though the
summits of the Arans were covered too. I set off up the long North
ridge of Aran Benllyn. After months of very wet weather, I was
expecting the ground to be completely sodden. However, it didn't seem
much worse than usual, which is still very wet! As I splashed upwards
through the bogs, I could see that the cloud was descending. I was
soon in the mist, although it wasn't actually raining.
</p>


<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Summit of Aran Benllyn</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2692.jpg" title="A title" class="rounded float-left" alt="Summit of Aran Benllyn"><img src="galleries/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2692.jpg"></a></b>


<p>
For some reason the North ridge always seems an awfully long way to
the summit (probably because it is). About 200m below the summit I met
a group of people descending and stopped for a short chat. Finally the
summit cairn of Aran Benllyn appeared out of the mist and I stopped
for a rest. I had hoped to continue over the summit of Aran Fawddwy
and continue round to the memorial cairn at Drws Bach camping near
Gwaun Lydan. As the weather showed no signs of improving I decided to
drop down from Erw y Ddafad-ddu to Creiglyn Dyfi. The only sensible
way down is via a steep grassy spur, which cuts through very steep
ground on the eastern face of the Arans. Finding the top of the spur
and picking the correct line of descent in the very limited visibility
could have proved very tricky. Anticipating this problem I
had loaded up a track from <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/">v-g's</a> web site into my Garmin GPS, which
lead me safely down into the cwm.
</p>


<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Camp at Creiglyn Dyfi</b></p>
<b> <a href="galleries/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2701.jpg" title="A title" class="rounded float-left" alt="Camp at Creiglyn Dyfi"><img src="galleries/2012-07-Arans/DSCF2701.jpg"></a></b>


<p>
The clag was well down and I only saw Creiglyn Dyfi when I was a
couple of hundred feet above it. Casting around for a decent spot to
camp, I settled on a very small level grassy area by the northern
shore. There was a small stream only a few yards away, which looked as
though it might flood my proposed site if there was a storm. However,
I decided to take the chance. As soon as I got the tent out it started
to rain. This was the first outing for my Terra Nova Voyager
Superlite. I had bought this tent in one of Field and Trek's 30%
discount, plus another 10% price matching from GoOutdoors. Although I
am very happy with my Zephyros 2, it isn't really suitable for two
people, whereas the Voyager has plenty of room. In fact it turns out
that the Voyager is slightly lighter than the Zephyros. However, it
does have one disadvantage. It's an inner pitch first and as I had
only put it up once indoors, so wasn't the fastest pitch. Just to make
life more difficult, there was only a very thin covering of grass over
the stones, so getting the pegs in was hard work. There were several
minutes of cursing before I finally got the tent up properly.
</p>

<p>
Of course as soon as I had got the tent up it stopped raining. As I
was very wet, I decided to go for a bit of a wander round the lake
before retiring to the tent and getting into some dry
clothes. Creiglyn Dyfi is a very inspiring place to camp. The
edge was somewhat taken off the experience by the persistent clag
obscuring the views of the Arans. I crawled inside the tent, got into
some dry clothes and cooked tea. For one the Voyager is super spacious
and in the poor weather the large porch was great for cooking and
storing my wet clothes.
</p>

<p>
During the night there were several heavy showers, but luckily the
small stream next to me didn't burst its banks. Peering out of the
tent at 5:30am the next morning I could see that the cloud had risen
above the summit of Aran Fawddwy. I had planned on a quick descent
back to the car via Cwm Llwydd and Talardd. However, the prospect of
views from the summit ridge was enticing. I decided to retrace my
route and savour the views up there.
</p>


<p>
<b> </b></p>
<p class="caption"><b>View SE from Aran Benllyn</b></p>

<p>
I packed away and began the long 1,000ft slog back up the grassy spur
to Erw y Ddafad-ddu. Inevitably as I climbed back up the steep slope,
the clag began to drop again. By the time I reached Erw y Ddafad-ddu
the whole ridge was covered. On the plus side, I could see a bright patch
where the sun was trying the break through and there was a steady
breeze. Sure enough by the time I had reached Aran Benllyn the clag
had mostly cleared the ridge, although Aran Fawddwy remained
covered. The air was exceptionally clear, so I got great views through
breaks in the mist. In some ways this was much better than unbroken
horizon to horizon views. Every few minutes a different patch of mist
would disperse and I would get a new view.
</p>

<p>
Dropping down from the summit of Aran Benllyn, I emerged completely
from the clag. Somehow the descent of the north ridge seemed even
longer than the ascent. Eventually I arrived back to the car, where I
got into some dry clothes and made a brew before setting off back
. Although the weather was far from perfect it had been a very
satisfying trip.

Another outing over the Carneddau, coinciding with a window of one and
a half days of decent weather in the current wet and cold. The trip
had to be fitted around dropping my son off early on a Saturday and
then collecting him late on the Sunday morning. As I drove along the
A55, I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Arriving at Ogwen around
9:30am it was already busy and I ended up parking opposite the MAM hut
at Glan Dena.

<p>
Getting out of the car, I could see that the Glyders were clear, but
there was a thin cap of cloud over Pen yr Ole Wen. I wanted to do a
decent walk on the Saturday, with a camp on a summit, leaving a short
walk on Sunday morning giving me plenty of time to get back to collect
my son. MWIS had promised that most summits would be clear of cloud
and the wind and rain wouldn't arrive until Sunday afternoon. On that
basis I decided to do a traverse of the main Carneddau ridge and camp
on Pen yr Helgi Du.

I packed my sack and set off past the MAM hut to join the south east
ridge of Pen yr Ole Wen. I had done the treverse the other way round
last year with one of my daughters whilst wearing my Inov8 Roclite
295's. I had found these to be very comfortable, even when
carrying a load. However, after all the wet weather I knew that I
would probably get wet feet, but in the end decided the greater
comfort of the Inov8's outweighed the dryer feet if I wore boots. I
managed to get only slightly damp feet on the pull up to the foot of
the south east ridge through several boggy patches.

Before starting up the ridge I filled my water bottles from the
stream. One disadvantage of the Carneddau is the lack of any reliable
water supply on the summits. Showell Styles in his "Backpacking in
Wales" describes the position of a spring on ????, but I have never
located it, although to be honest I haven't looked that hard. I
shouldered my rucksack, which had suddenly gone from "quite light" to
"heavy" with the addition of 3 kilos of water.
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the rocky gully I passed someone going quite slowly,
who said that he was part of a party walking over to Aber. Higher up I
met his companions, who said that he had the keys for their car parked
at Aber, so one way or another he was going to get there! The upper
section of the south east ridge seems to go on for ever. Each small
rise leading to yet another flatter section, which in turn leads to
another small rise. You can't really see the summit until you emerge
next to the cairn.

<p>
The top couple of hundred feet were misted out, so I didn't stop, but
continued down to the col between Pen yr Ole Wen and Carnedd
Dafydd. This was just below the cloud and I caught tantalising
glimpses of the sea to the west and the Ogwen valley to the east. Once
I started to gain height on the way to Carnedd Dafydd, I was once
again shrouded in mist. I stopped briefly on the summit to put on my
wind shirt, as there was a very cold breeze. Dropping down towards the
Black Ladders I emerged from the mist. In front of me I could see that
only the top of Carnedd Llewelyn was misted out. As I began climbing
the final slope to its summit a minor miracle happened and the mist
lifted. The summit was just clear of the clag when I reached it.

I thought I might wander over to Foel Grach. I wanted to have a look
around the shelter just below the summit. At one time someone from
down in the valley used to make weekly visits to the refuge to make
sure it was kept tidy and in a good sate of repair. The last time I
can remember visiting it was in 1982, when I signed the visitors book
there. However, just as I began to set off over the plateau, the mist
dropped again and the views disappeared. Decided to leave Foel Grach
for another day, I retraced my steps to the summit of Carnedd Dafydd
and began descending the ridge towards Craig yr Ysfa.

I soon dropped out of the cloud and stopped for lunch just off the
path, where I had <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/blog/mountaineering/backpacking/2011/09/05/carneddeau-summit-camp.html">camped</a> with my daughter on my last visit up
here. After finishing lunch and having a bit of a rest, I set off
towards Craig yr Ysfa. Peering over the cliffs I could see two
climbers high on Amphitheatre Buttress. If we ever get a warm settled
spell, this is one route I want to take the children up. It's probably
one of my favourite climbs. The climbing is generally easy, but
it is a compelling natural line, which finishes right on the summit. A
real "mountaineering" route.

When I reached the awkward rock step just above Bwlch Eryl Farchog, there was a
large party there. Fortunately, most of them had already climbed down,
so I didn't have to wait long. At the Bwlch they discussed whether to
descend directly to the reservoir track, or continue up to the summit
of Pen yr Helgi du. In the end they decided to follow me up the short
scramble that leads to the summit. It was only about 4:00pm when I
reached the summit and I debated continuing on to Pen Llithrig y Wrach
to camp there. However, I didn't fancy the trek back along the road
the next morning. By descending from Pen yr Helgi Du I could avoid the
road and walk along the old A5.

I set up the tent and made tea. By this time the cloud had cleared
from all the summits and the cold clear air meant that the views were
spectacular. Despite seeing quite a number of people out walking during
the day, I didn't see a single person after 6:00pm. Shortly after
9:00pm I was treated to a spectacular sunset. the temperature began
to drop rapidly and I retreated to my sleeping bag. I had a quiet
night with almost no wind. However, over on the Arans <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/G0099/G0099.htm">v-g</a> was
experiencing high winds around Creiglyn Dyfi. Just goes to show how
much conditions can vary, even over a relatively short distance.

I was up about 4:30am on the Sunday morning. Sunrise was due around
5:30am, but it was already light. Unlike my <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/blog/mountaineering/backpacking/2012/03/05/carneddau-overnighter.html">last</a> camp up here the
weather was good. It hadn't frozen during the night, but there was a
very cold breeze. I had a quick cup of hot chocolate and some cereal
bars before packing the tent up. I was away sometime before 6:00am and
headed down the south ridge back towards the valley. The light from
the rising sun made all sorts of interesting effects on the
surrounding mountains. I was soon back by the road. I ended up getting
the wettest feet of the whole trip in the short section of path
between the road and the old A5, where I couldn't dodge a very boggy
section, but had to wade through.

After a short rest in the car, I drove round to Pete's Eats for
breakfast and a short browse around Joe Brown's. This ended in a
shopping "accident". I noticed that they had some Inov8 Roclite 295,
the same as the pair I was wearing. These are probably the most
comfortable shoes I have had, both for general wear and for
walking. Thinking that Inov8 would either discontinue them, or bring
out an "improved" version I didn't like, I ended up buying another

I had planned to go for a walk in North Wales, but the <a href="http://www.mwis.org.uk">MWIS</a> forecast
wasn't too good. There was supposed to be a good chance of clear
summits, but with hail showers possibly merging into longer periods of
continuous downpours. The weather at home wasn't too bad, so i decided
to drive over without making any definite plans about my objective.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I dropped down off the A5104 towards Corwen it looked as
though the "showers merging to form longer periods of hail", was the
most likely option. I decide to drive into Capel Curig and see what
conditions looked like there. True to form its was pouring down and
all the summits were covered in dense grey cloud. Thinking that the
outlying summits might have better conditions I drove over to
Llanberis and thence towards Waun Fawr. Dropping down into the village
I could see that M. Mawr was misted out and it was still raining in
the valley. Continuing along the road to Rhydd Ddu, I pulled into the
car park to look at the Nantlle Ridge. This too was misted out, but
there appeared to be faint hope as the ridge connecting ???? to Moel
Hebog was partially clear.
</p>

<p>
I drove on towards Beddgelert thinking that I might climb Moel Hebog,
then continue along the connecting ridge towards ??? finally returning
via the forestry tracks. However, when I parked in Beddgelert it was
raining quite hard and the mist had descended even further. Clutching
at straws I decide to continue my grand tour of Snowdonia and drove
down towards Blaenau Ffestiniog, thinking that I might do another walk
in the Moelwyns. I could see that Cnicht was clear, but when I arrived
in Blaenau Ffestiniog it was raining even harder and all the
surrounding peaks were covered in the thick grey clag. It was now
after 2:00pm and I was considering doing a low level walk in the
rain. Somehow I felt that the weather would improve later in the day,
so to complete my circuit of Snowdonia I set off over the Crimea Pass
towards talkytoaster. As I approached the summit of the pass, I could
see that the cloud over Moel Siabod was starting to lift above the
summit and the rain was slowly dying out. By the time I reached the
car park outside Bryn y Glo in Capel Curig, the rain had stopped and
the sky was brightening.

<p>
It was now 3:00pm and I decided on an overnighter on the summit of
Siabod. This is one of my favourite mountains. It's isolated position
gives it grand views over most of Snowdonia. This would be my third
summit camp on Siabod. The first in <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/mountaineering/night-on-moel-siabod.html">May</a> time was in perfect
weather. The <a href="http://ian-barton.com/blog/mountaineering/2011/08/14/zephyros-on-moel-siabod.html">second</a> with one of my daughters, was in very uncertain
weather, with high winds on the summit. However, we were luck and
despite the very high wind we had good views, but a very noisy night
as the tent flapped in the wind.

<p>
I packed my sack and was soon making my way past the water falls at
Pont y Cyfnyg and up the farm track towards the mountain. As I gained
height I could see the tops of the Carneddau were covered in
snow. Earlier in the day I glimpsed a covering of snow on Siabod
through breaks in the cloud. However, it appeared to have melted
during the day. As I climbed up the huge grey clouds began to disperse
and soon there ere large blue patches everywhere. Visibility was
excellent, the rain and cold air ensuring there was no haze to obscure
the views.

<p>
I intended to climb the Ddear Ddu ridge, so turned left at the ladder
style at the end of the farm track. I mad my way through the old
quarry workings and climbed up to the small col above llyn y
Foel. Dropping down towards the lake the ground was very wet. By
weaving about and some tussock hopping I avoided getting my feet too
wet. I could see someone at the bottom of the Ddear Ddu ridge, but
this was the only person I saw all day. I stopped to fill my Platypus
bottles from the lake before beginning the ascent. Although the rock
was wet, it didn't seem greasy. I kept close to the right hand side of
the ridge, to enjoy the exposure. The ridge always seems longer than
it looks from below. Not that it matters, as the climbing is so
enjoyable. Eventually I arrived at the final rocks below the summit
cairn and made my way onto the summit ridge so I could enjoy the views
over the far side. There was a stiff breeze and it felt very cold.

<p>
I was keen to get the tent up quickly and chose to pitch on the
slightly sloping grass platform on the South East side of the summit,
where I had pitched with my daughter. Unfortunately, I pitched a
little too far up the slope and wasn't able to get a good taut pitch,
as the ground wasn't level enough. As it was very cold I didn't want
to take the tent down and move it, so I decided it would do. I chucked
all my gear into the tent and began to make tea. On overnighters I
alternate between eating Bewell Hot Cereal Start and Porridge with
Sultanas. Since it's only an evening meal and a breakfast it doesn't
get too boring. Although dehydrated food has come a long way since my
1976 trip to Scandanavia, the only varieties I really enjoy are the
porridge and Hot Cereal Start. Stupidly I had forgotten my pot cosy,
so has to add a little extra hot water just before eating my meal, as
it had cooled down quite a bit.

<p>
It was now almost sunset, so I had a walk around the summit and took
some photos. The wind was very cold and I was only just warm enough
with all the layers I had brought with me. I dived back into the tent,
where my thermometer showed it was only 2.5C. The angle of the slope
was just enough for me to slide down my Exped UL Synmat. Eventually,
stuck a load of gear at the end of the tent and wedged my feet against
it to stop me sliding. It brought back memories of a bivouac near to
the summit of the Matterhorn many years ago. There are lots of ledges
on the Matterhorn, but most of them slope outwards. During the night I
kept sliding down the ledge and ending up being brought up sharp by
the rope. At least this time I was warm. On the Matterhorn I had no
sleeping bag and the night was spent shivering violently until that
warmed me up and slithering down the ledge.

<p>
Looking out of my tent at first light the ground was white over. At
first it appeared as though the summit was misted out, but it was only
a very thin layer and it soon dispersed to give excellent views. I had
a feeling that the good weather might not last, so after a quick
breakfast began to pack away. I was just taking the tent down when a
brief snow storm blew in, to make the job more difficult. It soon
cleared and I began to make my way back down towards the Eastern ridge. I
traversed below the rocky crest, wanting to avoid the ice glazed rock
while carrying a relatively heavy sack.

<p>
I was soon making my way down the series of depressions in the North East
ridge, which lead back to the farm track. Part of the way down the
track, I met a group of young people trudging up hill bent under the
weight of huge rucksacks.

<p>
Arriving back at the car I drove over to Llanberis for the traditional
cholesterol overload at Pete's Eats. When I emerged from the cafe, I
could see that I had been right about the weather and all the summits
were again misted out and it was drizzling steadily. It had been a
great trip and I was very lucky to get a short window of good weather
in the current dreary conditions.

Lake Vyrnwy is an ideal route for children. Although the road around
the lake is open to traffic, its winding nature and the presence of
many other cyclists keeps motorists speeds down. The total distance
around the lake is around 12 miles and the road is almost completely
flat.
</p>

<p>
There are several parking places around the lake, and a cafe near the
dam.

For those wanting a harder ride there is an absolutely fantastic ride
to Bala. It's usual to start the ride from Bala. There is around 600m
of ascent and the total length of the ride is about 35 miles. From
Bala the ride gains the col at Bwlch-y-Groes, which has fine views
over the Arans. At 1800ft this is the highest pass in Wales. You can
let your legs recover on the descent to the lake and have a well
earned piece of cake in the cafe near the dam. The way back to Bala
takes the other road from the end of the lake up through Cwm Hirnant
before descending back to Bala.

This was another trip shamelessly nicked from <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/T0863/T0863.htm">v-g's</a> web site. I was
hoping to do it with the children, but the weather forecast looked too
dodgy to take them. The initial plan was either to do this trip, or
another one over the Arans. Read on to see why I didn't do the Arans
trip.

<p>
MWIS forecast good chance of clear summits, but with heavy hail
showers blowing in. I was hoping to complete my aborted trip over Aran
Benllyn, camping at Creiglyn Dyfi and walking out the next day. As I
drove through Whitchurch the heavens opened, but once I arrived at
Wrexham the roads were dry and the sun was out. However, as I
approached the A5 outside Corwen, I could see thick cloud in front. As
I arrived at the traffic lights at the end of the A5104, it began
pouring with rain. Hoping it might just be a heavy shower I turned off
the A5 towards Bala. After three or four miles I could see that there
were no breaks in the cloud and it was absolutely pouring down. There
didn't seem to be any point in continuing, so I turned the car round
at set off back along the A5 towards Capel Curig.
</p>

<p>
After only a few miles along the A5 it had stopped raining. As I
approached Pentrefoelas I could see that the most of the main summits
were either cloud free, or only lightly covered. However, I didn't
think that the weather would be suitable for camping on one of the
higher summits around Capel Curig, so I turned off along the B4407
towards Blaenau Ffestiniog . I parked at the small car park at the end
of the access road to Llyn Stwlan. The skies were very grey, but the
summits of the Moelwyns were clear of cloud.
</p>

<p>
I packed my sack and glanced at my watch. It was now 4:00pm, but I
reckoned that I would have more than enough time to get to the summit
of Moelwyn Bach. I followed a man walking his dog up the road towards
the resevoir, where I filled my water bottles. It's not possible to
walk along the top of the wall to get to the far side, so I had to
descend a short distance to get back to the start of the path. I
didn't particularly want to go up to the col at Bwlch Stwlan between
the two peaks, as I would have to descend from Moelwyn Bach over the
same ground. So thought I would climb up the end of the South Ridge
and traverse it to the summit of Molewyn Bach before descending to
Bwlch Stwlan. I worked over to the left towards the base of the ridge,
following a line of small concrete marker posts. As I gained height, I
could see a huge hole in the hill, presumably some old quarry
workings. Looking up at the ridge I could see that I would have to
climb over a rocky section to gain the crest. From below this didn't
look too hard, but I was conscious that I was pressed for time and I
didn't want to waste time if I picked the wrong line up the
hill. Luckily, there appeared to be a terrace that ran across the face
of the hill, leading to the col. There was a distinct path along most
of the terrace, with a couple of interesting sections where parts
of the path had collapsed.
</p>

<p>
At Bwlch Stwlan I was exposed to the wind blowing in from the West. I
thought of dumping my pack at the Bwlch while I climbed up to the
summit of Moelwyn Bach. For some stupid reason I was worried that
someone might take it, even though it was late in the day and there
was nobody else about. Thus, I ended up carying it all the way to the
top and back again. Most of the path up towards the summit is on the
East face, which was sheltered from the wind. However, once I gained
the summit ridge I was exposed to its full force. The clouds had been
coming and going around the summit while I was climbing up, but when I
reached the summit cairn there were good views in all directions. I
tried to brace myself against the cairn to take some photos, but it
was almost impossible in the buffeting wind.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of minutes on top, I retraced my steps to the col and
began the ascent of Moelwyn Mawr via Craigysgafn. I could see sheets
of "stuff" blowing in from the west. Within a few seconds I was being
shot blasted by small hail stones. I was exposed to the full force of
the wind for most of the climb and the layer of hail on the rock made
the scrambling sections interesting. I was very relieved when the hail
ceased just before I got to the summit cairn.
</p>

<p>
There is a small grassy platform just below the summit cairn, which
seemed quite sheltered. However, I was worried that the wind might
shift round during the night and in any case the summit was completely
misted out. I knew that somewhere there was an easy descent back
towards Llyn Croesor, but in the clag I couldn't see an easy way down
the steep ground. I pulled out the map and decided to descend the
North West ridge and then traverse over towards Llyn Croesor. It was
now well after 6:00pm and I wanted to find a good sport before it went
dark.
</p>

<p>
I hurried down the North West ridge hoping to drop out of the clag. I
wasn't entirely sure exactly where I was and in the words of the great
HW Tilman "No one goes so far, or so fast, as the man who does not
know where he is going". Eventually I dropped below the clag to fine
views of Cwm Croesor. It didn't look as though I could traverse easily
and the alternative was a long descent, followed by an equally long
climb back up.

<p>
I made the decision to do what I should have done in the first place -
camp on the summit. I had lost just over a hundred metres, so it was a
bit of a slog back up. When I finally got back there, the wind seemed
to have dropped considerably, but it was still misted out. I was wet
through and my fingers were freezing as I struggled to get the tent
up. I had just finished putting it up when suddenly the clag cleared
and I could see from horizon to horizon. The sun was setting and it
would be dark soon. Once I had thrown everything into the tent, I went
for a short walk around the summit area. In the perfect visibility I
now easily found the start of the descent path. I set a waypoint on my
GPS, so I could find it again in the morning.
</p>

<p>
I made my way back to the tent to get into some dry gear and cook
tea. The spot I had chosen turned out to be very sheltered and I had a
quiet night.

I was up around 6:30am. Looking out of the tent the
summit was still shrouded in mist, but the wind had dropped and it
wasn't hailing or raining. As I was packing away the tent,
there were several spells of just a few seconds when the cloud would
clear and I could see the views. I waited for a while, but it didn't
seem as though the cloud would disperse for more than a few seconds at
a time, so I set off. I found the start of the descent easily now I
knew where it was and had soon dropped out of the clag.

<p>
I made my way over towards Moel yr Hydd and was treated to some mini
cloud inversions in the valley over Blaneau. The summit of Moel yr
Hydd was clear and I paused to take some photos before descending
towards the old quarry workings. I made my way down through the levels
towards Llyn Cwm Orthin. The weather was gradually getting worse as I
descended. The clouds were dropping and the drizzle was turning into
persistent rain. However, I managed to get back to the car before it
got too bad.

<p>
Overall a very satisfying trip. I was lucky that the gaps in the bad
weather came at just the right moments and on the second day I got
back to the car just before it got really bad!
</p>

<p>
Some notes about gear:
</p>

<p>
Once again my Rab Vapour Rise trousers and jacket worked
superbly. Although they absorbed water my skin was dry. In the morning
the trousers were heavy with the water they had absorbed. As it wasn't
far above freezing, I wasn't looking forward to putting them
on. However, the inner fleece lining felt dry and far from having cold
legs, I immediately felt warm.

I had wanted to do an overnight trip since Christmas. I had planned to
spend at least one night camping high in the snow. Unfortunately, this
year the winter seems to have come and gone with almost no serious
snow in North Wales. Not only has there been very little snow, but
there has been lots of wind and rain, with almost no settled good
weather.
</p>

<p>
Last Friday MWIS was predicting early fog in the valleys with the tops
clearing later in the day. This looked like being my only opportunity
to get out for a while. However, I had to be in Chester by midday on
the Saturday to collect my son from his rowing training.
</p>

<p>
I packed the truck on Thursday night as I planned to make an early
start. I dropped the children off to catch the school bus just after
7:30am and made my way over towards Capel Curig. As I dropped down
from the A5104 towards Corwen I could see the predicted fog in the
valley. Luckily, it was only a small patch and I soon ran into clearer
weather.
</p>


<p>
I parked up behind Joe Browns in Capel Curig and began packing my
sack. Amazingly I didn't seem to have forgotten anything, until I went
to get my boots. In an instant Victor Meldrew moment, I realized that
I had left them at home. Given the problems I have finding anything I
like and the fact that I didn't need a new pair, I ruled out going
into the shop to buy a new pair. I was wearing my Inov8 Roclite 295,
which I often use on the mountains. As it was the beginning of March,
the ground was going to be very wet and I don't really like getting
wet feet. I didn't really have much choice, so I set off along
Telford's old A5.
</p>

<p>
The plan was to repeat <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/T0956/T0956.htm">v-g's</a> route over Pen Llithrig y Wrach and Pen
yr Helgi Du. I am hopeless at estimating route times, but I was happy
that I could make it back from the summit of Pen yr Helgi Du to the
centre of Chester by twelve o'clock the next day. Thus the plan was to
camp on the summit of Pen yr Helgi Du and make an early start on
Saturday.

<p>
As I tramped down the road, MWIS was proving accurate and the clouds
around the summits began to disperse. I crossed the A5 and began to
climb up towards Llyn Colwyd. There were some wet areas, but by
hopping about a bit I managed to keep my feet dry. I got the camera
out to take some photos. I had checked the battery a couple of days
ago, but in the intervening time Anne had been taking dozens of photos
of stuff she wanted to sell on eBay. So when I switched the camera on
the battery died immediately. Luckily, I had my phone, which has a
reasonable camera.
</p>

<p>
I stopped to fill my water bottles from the stream that runs down into
the reservoir and began to make my way towards Pen Llithrig y
Wrach. On the way I noticed several big patches of frogspawn in pools
on the path. I hope there aren't any severe frosts in the next few
weeks.
</p>

<p>
Finding the start of the path up the south ridge of Pen Llithrig y
Wrach was problematic. I chose a fairly direct route up the flank to
join the ridge. Unfortunately, this involved crossing an area of
quaking bog and my feet were soon soaked. No matter, it was a superb
Spring morning with great views in all directions.  I continued up
steep grass and heather and I didn't really find the path until
shortly below the summit plateau. It was then I spotted two people
descending, who were actually on the path, so I joined it for the
final hundred feet or so onto the plateau.
</p>

<p>
I was planning to eat lunch at the summit, but there was a very cold
breeze, so I munched on a Kit Kat while I descended towards Bwlch y
Tri Marchog, where I found a sheltered spot to eat the other Kit Kat
and some biscuits. Suitably fortified I began the slog up towards Pen
yr Helgi Du.
</p>

<p>
It was only about 1:30pm when I arrived at the summit and the whole of
the Carneddau were bathed in the early afternoon sun. It was very
tempting to carry on up towards Carnedd Llewelyn, but I knew if I did,
I would have to make the early part of the descent in dark before dawn
dark in order to get back to the car in time. As subsequent events
proved, it was lucky that I decided not to carry on.

<p>
I pitched the tent near to the summit, while being watched by a group
of wild ponies a few yards away. There was a bit of a breeze, but MWIS
had predicted that there would be very little wind for the rest of
today or on the Saturday morning. Once I had pitched the tent, I made
up a Bewell hot porridge and sultanas and drank a big mug of hot
chocolate. I spent the rest of the afternoon wandering round the
summit area and enjoying the afternoon sun. Wandering towards a pool I
saw what looked like a cairn. It seemed a funny colour and as there
were no rocks nearby and I wondered why someone had bothered to build
it there. When I got closer I realized that it was a pile of horse
dung, in a perfect cairn shape.

<p>
Often I arrive at the place where I am going to pitch my tent just
before it goes dark and rush to get everything set up. So it was a
real pleasure to have plenty of time to mooch about. I saw no one on
the main Carneddau ridge and only two people Pen yr Helgi Du. Just
before 6:00pm I was treated to a spectacular sunset over Carnedd Dafydd.
</p>

<p>
I settled down in the tent to read on my Kindle and catch up with some
podcasts. MWIS had predicted cloudy summits, but minimal wind and no
precipitation for the next morning. Sure enough when I looked out of
the tent later on the mist had come down.
</p>

<p>
Sometime in the early hours of the morning, the wind got up and there
was a heavy shower. As the night wore on the showers became more
frequent and by 4:00am it was raining continuously. At 6:00am, in the
pre-dawn light I decided that the best thing to do was to bail and
return to the valley for some breakfast. I had a quick cup of hot
chocolate and some biscuits and packed away the contents of the tent
into my rucksack.
</p>

<p>
It was time to go outside. I only had my shirt, a Rab Generator pullon
and my Marmot LiteSpeed, plus Mammut Base Jump trews. I pulled my
Lowe Alpine hat down hard to stop it blowing away and got out of the
tent. Outside the rain was just at the point where it begins to fall
as sleet. Inside the tent it didn't sound too windy, but outside the
rain was being blown in sheets. I collapsed the tent as fast as
possible and stuffed the bits into my sack. Much as I like my Zephyros,
the short vertical poles really get in the way when you want to
pack it quickly. Within a couple of minutes I was completely soaked
and starting to feel cold.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the long south ridge of Pen yr Helgi Du is easy to
navigate. I was just warm enough when I was moving, but had it been a
few degrees colder it would have been very unpleasant. I was relieved
that I hadn't decided to continue up to the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn
the previous afternoon. Finally I dropped out of the clag and could
see the valley below me. I hadn't really planned my descent, thinking
that I could cut across back towards Llyn Colwyd and reverse my route
of ascent.

<p>
However, I was now operating Plan "B" - get down to the road as fast
as possible. It turns out that this was exactly the route followed by
v-g. My main concern was how to cross the stream, so I could get back
on the old A5, without going all the way down the road to the camp
site. However, when I emerged onto the main A5 opposite Helyg, there
was an obvious path with a couple of bridges to get over the stream
and back onto the old road.
</p>

<p>
I arrived back in Capel Curig about 9:15am. As soon as I stopped
walking I began to feel very, very cold. The car park was fairly
crowded with people setting off for the day, but I just wanted to get
into some dry stuff as fast as possible. I stripped off behind the
truck and put on my dry clothes. Several old ladies fainted and the
rest of the crowd grinned.

<p>
Once inside the truck, with dry clothes on, I still couldn't get
warm, even with the heater on the "Chernobyl Meltdown" setting. I
realized that in the last 24hrs I had only eaten two tea cakes, two
Kit Kats, some porridge and half a packet of biscuits. The problem was
lack of food, so I put the truck on auto-pilot and set off for Pete's
Eats. After a large breakfast, I felt much better and I even made it
to Chester just before midday.
</p>

<p>
I learnt a couple of things from the trip. First I don't mind wet feet
anything like as much as I though I did. In fact most of the time they
didn't feel wet, although my socks were still damp. I might try
walking in trail shoes and giving up boots completely. Second,
although I could have completed the trip as a day walk and avoided
getting soaked, I really enjoyed the time I spent just mooching about
near to the tent. As the days get longer, I would like to plan some
trips where I spend less time walking and more time relaxing around
the tent.
